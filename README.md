[Some references to open access resources: books, articles, PhD theses, Geohug and Ore Deposits Hub talks](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/tree/main/References)

**Goals**: 
* To share the open access references and some code on topics that I like most: **geochemistry**, **data science**, **mineral systems** and **ore deposits**, and **reflected light petrography**.
* Organize the notes from the Ore Deposits course and the Reflected light petrography course materials, trying to create links between these two courses when possible. 

Additionally, I would like to test some ideas:

* To what degree can thin section descriptions be automated? Would it help students if they could extract quantitative features like color, grain size and shape and their distribution and focus on texture description and genetic interpretation? 

* Can I run some basic NLP code to extract key concepts from published literature and the lecture notes? Can these be linked to thin section descriptions and assign probabilities to possible interpretation based on textural criteria? 

**Disclaimer**: any of my notes, translations or interpretations presented here may be incorrect. 

I express my sincere gratitude to everyone who shares their knowledge and to the lecturers that taught the Ore deposits and Reflected light petrography courses at the ETH, where I had the privilege of first taking the courses and then assisting them – links to their open access papers are in the [References](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/tree/main/References) section, with the lecturers’ names in bold. 

[Information on the current edition of the Ore Deposits course is here](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?semkez=2023W&ansicht=ALLE&lerneinheitId=172259&lang=en)

Anyone in Zurich can register at the ETH as an auditor and visit the course with the permission of the lecturer.

## Lecture 2. Introduction to ore-forming processes

There is a particular period in the Proterozoic in Australia when some of the largest Pb-Zn and also Cu deposits formed. There are 3 features that are unique, and occur for the first time in the world’s history there. 

* One is the preparation of the tectonic basement of this old continent that has a much older pre-history, which leads to fault structuring and then determines the architecture of sedimentary basin. At this stage it becomes a shelf basin with sub-basins in which these ore deposits form by sedimentary-exhalative processes. 

* Also the first time for globally extensive evaporitic conditions, which means lots of salty fluids present. 

* Finally, it is also a time that culminated after several inter-continental orogeny stages that included a lot of granite magmatism. Crustal granite magmatism has the effect of acting as a heat source and transferring U, Th, K closer to the surface. This input of extra energy into the system is another feature that correlates with the emergence of ore deposits shortly after.

Two contrasting examples: 

**McArthur river deposits**: the biggest SEDEX Pb-Zn deposit, unaffected by later metamorphism. Ore horizons are interbedded with coarse-grained turbidite breccias, submarine rockfall breccias that obviously fell into this basin while chemical sedimentation was happening. The evidence – squishy clasts in the breccia core, sample A4

Dropstones of breccia clasts falling into the basin, while chemical sediment with the ore was still soft. 

**Mt Isa** story starts similarly. It is about the same age, Pb Zn orebodies that are stratiform except there are no prominent breccias, but there was a major event, Isan orogeny, which caused folding, shortening and heating of the rock package to variable degrees. In the course of these events, the rocks of the SEDEX cycle, of this rift-sag sequence, were put into vertical position and subsequently brecciated. The main difference of this type of breccia: PbS and ZnS are so ductile that rocks falls apart during deformation, but it has nothing to do with the fluid infill and mineralization. This is a passive deformational low-grade metamorphic overprint, as opposed to McArthur river breccia – which includes a re-brecciation of already fully consolidated rock, and the hydrothermal infill of quartz and chalcopyrite. The same starting sedimentary-exhalative history, overprinted by much later, metamorphic fluid overprint that brings in the Cu.

**Introduction to hydrothermal systems**

Ore formation is element enrichment. Trace elements need to be collected from big crustal volume, dissolved in a fluid, mechanically focused in the place where it precipitates again in a more concentrated form.

** ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ what if the ore-forming process is not complete without epigenetic ore enrichment? Would it make sense to add another line?

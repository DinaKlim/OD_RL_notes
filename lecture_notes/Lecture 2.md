## Lecture 2. Introduction to ore-forming processes

There is a particular period in the Proterozoic in Australia when some of the largest Pb-Zn and also Cu deposits formed. There are 3 features that are unique, and occur for the first time in the world’s history there. 

* One is the preparation of the tectonic basement of this old continent that has a much older pre-history, which leads to **fault structuring** and then determines the architecture of sedimentary basin. At this stage it becomes a shelf basin with sub-basins in which these ore deposits form by sedimentary-exhalative processes. 

* Also the first time for globally extensive **evaporitic conditions**, which means lots of salty fluids present. 

* Finally, it is also a time that culminated after several inter-continental orogeny stages that included a lot of **granite magmatism**. Crustal granite magmatism has the effect of acting as a **heat source** and transferring U, Th, K closer to the surface. This input of extra energy into the system is another feature that correlates with the emergence of ore deposits shortly after.

Two contrasting examples: 

**McArthur river deposits**: the biggest SEDEX Pb-Zn deposit, unaffected by later metamorphism. Ore horizons are interbedded with coarse-grained turbidite breccias, submarine rockfall breccias that obviously fell into this basin while chemical sedimentation was happening. The evidence – squishy clasts in the breccia core, sample A4

<img src="https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/lecture_notes/samples_macro/A4.jpg" alt="Sample A4" style="width:50%;">

Dropstones of breccia clasts falling into the basin, while chemical sediment with the ore was still soft. 

**Mt Isa** story starts similarly. It is about the same age, Pb Zn orebodies that are stratiform except there are no prominent breccias, but there was a major event, Isan orogeny, which caused folding, shortening and heating of the rock package to variable degrees. In the course of these events, the rocks of the SEDEX cycle, of this rift-sag sequence, were put into vertical position and subsequently brecciated. The main difference of this type of breccia: PbS and ZnS are so ductile that rocks falls apart during deformation, but it has nothing to do with the fluid infill and mineralization. This is a passive deformational low-grade metamorphic overprint, as opposed to McArthur river breccia – which includes a re-brecciation of already fully consolidated rock, and the hydrothermal infill of quartz and chalcopyrite. The same starting sedimentary-exhalative history, overprinted by much later, metamorphic fluid overprint that brings in the Cu.

**Introduction to hydrothermal systems**

Ore formation is element enrichment. Trace elements need to be collected from big crustal volume, dissolved in a fluid, mechanically focused in the place where it precipitates again in a more concentrated form.

``¯\_(ツ)_/¯`` What if the ore-forming process is not complete without epigenetic ore enrichment? Would it make sense to add another line?

**Metal solubility** is the main limiting factor in terms of the source for most sediment-hosted mineral systems.

Solubilities of the base metal sulfides vary by orders of magnitude.

Ore-forming factors are a combination of physics and chemistry. Further discussion will focus on the source region and the point that getting the metals in solution is the most serious constraint in making an ore-forming hydrothermal system. And the reason is that metal solubilities vary by huge numbers of orders of magnitudes. 

![Metal solubility](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/lecture_notes/Lecture%202%20images/Solubility%20T.JPG)

[Fontboté, L., Kouzmanov, K., Chiaradia, M., & Pokrovski, G. S. (2017). Sulfide minerals in hydrothermal deposits. Elements, 13(2), 97-103.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316092040_Sulfide_Minerals_in_Hydrothermal_Deposits)

``¯\_(ツ)_/¯`` what in the name of Gibbs does this phrase "sulphur and O2 buffered by pyrite - hematite - magnetite" mean? Does this mean that the rock has an infinite reservoir of all of those three phases? Apparently not. “Buffered by py–mt–hm” means that the oxygen fugacity (fO₂) and sulfur fugacity (fS₂) of a fluid are controlled by equilibrium with the mineral assemblage pyrite (FeS₂), magnetite (Fe₃O₄), and hematite (Fe₂O₃). At a given temperature, reactions among these minerals fix specific redox conditions, so the fluid adjusts its O and S activities to remain in equilibrium with the solids. This does not require infinite amounts of these minerals; it simply means the rock contains sufficient quantities relative to the fluid (i.e., a high rock/fluid ratio) so that mineral reactions can proceed without depleting either phase. In geological terms, the redox state of the fluid is determined by the host rock mineralogy rather than by the fluid’s initial composition. For a deeper dive into activity / fugacity /partial molar Gibbs free energy, there are [notes from James Connolly's thermodynamics course at the ETH Zurich](https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/thermo_course/thermo_course.pdf). Pythonizing the problems and solutions from this course in on my bucket list. 

Solubility, or the possibility to get the metals from the source region into the solution that will transport the metals to the deposition site, is the key SOURCE limiting factor. It depends on four key variables:

* Salinity
* Acidity
* Redox
* Temperature

There are so many different factors that all influence solubility, and all in different direction. Since it is a multicomponent problem, there is metal sulfide, it depends not only on one chemical element, but also other chemical elements in the system, which always includes rocks and minerals on one hand and the fluid on the other hand. Salinity, acidity, pH, redox and T are are the source variables that determine whether it will be possible to create the ore-bearing fluid.

**Why do salty fluids transport base metals?** 

Reason 1:

CHLORIDE COMPLEX FORMATION

PbS + 2 H⁺ = Pb²⁺ + H₂S

K (250 °C) = [Pb²⁺] · [H₂S] / [H⁺]² = 0.01

This reaction describes acid-promoted dissolution of galena (PbS).

Activities of pure solids (PbS) are taken as 1, so they do not appear in the expression.

A small equilibrium constant (K = 0.01) means the reaction is not strongly product-favored: without chloride, PbS dissolves only modestly.

In the presence of chloride, equilibrium constant is 100. Pb²⁺ does not remain as a free ion, but forms a chloride complex (represented here as PbCl₂). Complex formation removes Pb²⁺ from solution in its free form.

According to Le Châtelier’s principle, removing a product (Pb²⁺) drives more PbS dissolution.

PbS + 2 H⁺ + 2 Cl⁻ = PbCl₂ + H₂S

K (250 °C) = [PbCl₂] · [H₂S] / ([H⁺]² · [Cl⁻]²) = 100

Galena solubility up 10,000-fold in seawater-salinity fluid, compared with pure water of same pH.

**Second reason why saline, rock-buffered fluids are better at transporting base metals** (rock buffered means in equilibrium with the feldspar, mica/clay and quartz)

SALTY FLUIDS ARE ACID FLUIDS

High Cl⁻ in rock-buffered fluids means high Na⁺ and high K⁺

KAlSi₃O₈ + Na⁺ = NaAlSi₃O₈ + K⁺

K-spar --------- albite

Fluids are in contact with crustal rocks, which contain KFS and micas. NaCl is the dominant salt in the fluid. It is in contact with FSp (plagioclase and intermediate sodic plagioclase which we can approximate with albite). As shown by the equation, the more Na you have in the fluid, the more K you will need to have in the fluid: it is an equilibrium, you push one up, the other need to go up too. If we have high K concentrations, another chemical reaction kicks in. 

KAl₃Si₃O₁₀(OH)₂ + 6 SiO₂ + 2 K⁺ = 3 KAlSi₃O₈ + 2 H⁺

muscovite ------------------------ K-spar

The reaction shown is fundamentally an exchange reaction in which aluminum is conserved. This is important because Al is among the least soluble major rock-forming elements under most crustal conditions. As a result, reactions involving feldspars and micas tend to redistribute Al among solid phases rather than transfer it into solution. The fluid phase instead accommodates changes in the more mobile components (K⁺, Na⁺, H⁺, OH⁻).

The earlier reaction between K-feldspar (KAlSi₃O₈) and albite (NaAlSi₃O₈) is a classic alkali exchange reaction, where Na⁺ and K⁺ are exchanged between fluid and feldspar while the Al–Si framework remains intact. Aluminum is conserved in the solid structure, and only the alkali cations are redistributed.

The muscovite–K-feldspar reaction follows the same general principle but involves hydrogen as an additional exchange component:

Here:

Muscovite contains structurally bound OH groups.

K-feldspar is OH-free.

The reaction exchanges K⁺ from the fluid for H⁺ released to the fluid.

Aluminum remains entirely in solid phases.

In compositional terms, this is an exchange between:

A hydrous mineral with relatively lower K/Al (muscovite),

And an anhydrous mineral with higher K/Al (K-feldspar).

As fluid K⁺ activity increases, the equilibrium shifts to the right. This produces additional H⁺ in solution, thereby lowering pH. In other words, elevated K⁺ concentrations in saline fluids promote reactions that generate acidity.

Because high Cl⁻ fluids in rock-buffered systems imply high Na⁺ and K⁺ concentrations (charge balance constraints in saline brines), such fluids tend to shift feldspar–mica equilibria toward H⁺ production.

The key conclusion is:

When saline (Cl-rich) fluids equilibrate with dominant crustal minerals, alkali exchange reactions generate H⁺. Therefore, salty fluids are intrinsically acid fluids under rock-buffered equilibrium conditions.

This is a thermodynamic consequence of mineral–fluid exchange equilibria, not simply an incidental property of dissolved salts.

![Two PH buffer](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/lecture_notes/Lecture%202%20images/two%20PH%20buffer.jpg)

This diagram applies to granites, arkosic sediments, and any rocks containing quartz, feldspars, muscovite, and illite (illite being the low-temperature form of muscovite).

It is a plot of Temperature vs. log(K⁺/H⁺).

Because:

log(K⁺/H⁺) = log K⁺ − log H⁺
pH = −log H⁺

for a given K⁺ concentration, increasing log(K⁺/H⁺) corresponds approximately to increasing pH.

Left side  → low log(K⁺/H⁺) → high H⁺ → low pH → acidic  
Right side → high log(K⁺/H⁺) → low H⁺ → higher pH → neutral to alkaline  

The exact numerical values are not important; the diagram shows relative stability fields.

**Feldspar–Muscovite Buffer (Granite / Arkose Buffer)**

KAlSi₃O₈ + H⁺ = KAl₃Si₃O₁₀(OH)₂ + SiO₂ + K⁺

K-feldspar + H⁺ = muscovite + quartz + K⁺

This is an exchange reaction between K⁺ and H⁺.

K-feldspar (KAlSi₃O₈) is OH-free and relatively K-rich.  
Muscovite (KAl₃Si₃O₁₀(OH)₂) contains structural OH.  

Increasing H⁺ drives the reaction to the right (more muscovite).  
Increasing K⁺ drives it to the left (more K-feldspar).  

Under more neutral to mildly alkaline conditions, the stable assemblage is:

quartz + K-feldspar + muscovite

This assemblage buffers the pH of fluids in granites and arkosic sediments.

**Muscovite–Kaolinite Buffer (Clay Buffer)**

Schematic reaction:

muscovite + H⁺ = kaolinite + K⁺

More explicitly (simplified form):

KAl₃Si₃O₁₀(OH)₂ + H⁺ → Al₂Si₂O₅(OH)₄ + K⁺ + SiO₂

Muscovite still contains significant K.  
Kaolinite (Al₂Si₂O₅(OH)₄) is a clay mineral with very low K.  

Higher H⁺ concentration is required to destabilize muscovite and form kaolinite.  
Therefore, this reaction lies further on the acidic (low-pH) side.

At sufficiently high acidity, clay minerals buffer the pH.  
At more neutral conditions, muscovite + feldspars buffer the pH.

Crustal rocks buffer the pH of fluids that are in equilibrium with them.

There are two main pH-buffer regimes:

* Clay mineral buffer (kaolinite ± illite) → lower pH
  
* Granite/arkose buffer (quartz + K-feldspar + muscovite) → neutral to mildly alkaline pH  

These buffering systems have a strong effect on metal solubility.  
Small shifts in mineral assemblage can produce large changes in fluid acidity and therefore metal mobility.

Example – comparison:

CANNING BASIN Mississippi Valley Type PbZn

McARTHUR RIVER Stratiform PbZn at H.Y.C.

Similar total metal tonnage

Similar geochemical problem:
PbS solubility at source

Are Pb, Zn and H₂S transported in single ore fluid?

The following is just an illustration of how big this effect is of different buffer conditions where you have got pH for a given salinity, and the question is how to make a Pb-Zn deposits. Two settings, Canning basin MVT type and McArthur river, stratiform Pb Zn deposit. In total there is about the same amount of Pb and Zn there, and it is the same challenge, how do you get enough Pb in solution? 
We can make a simplifying assumption that Pb is contained in galena (PbS). Let us explore what is required to make Pb Zn and H2S transported by one fluid and precipitated there.

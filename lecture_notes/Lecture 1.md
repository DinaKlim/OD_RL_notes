A continent surrounded by extended ridges. 
Old continent rifted away and protected from destruction. 
Northern part: Grassberg, the biggest porphyry Cu deposit. Subduction zones, water transported up and provided fluids, generation of calc-alkaline magmas. 
High erosion rates, young orogenic belts. Bauxite deposits in old continental settings. 
Geophysical map shows blocks with internal structure (TMI). 

Archean rocks in the Western part of the Australian continent, Proterozoic rocks in the center (platforms and intracontinental ‘mobile belts’ and continental basins later), Phanerozoic rocks in the Eastern part (Palaeozoic accretion).

The Archean rocks host Fe, Au and Ni deposits. Hydrothermal enrichment of banded iron formation leads to creation of high-grade Fe deposits in the Western Australia. Ni deposits are associated with greenstone belts and komatiites.   
Early Ordovician to Early Cretaceous Canning Basin in Western Australia: epicontinental basins, for example Canning Basin. Mississippi-Valley-Type (MVT), Pb-Zn-deposits in Devonian reef carbonates
Eastern Australia: Tasman Fold Belt, continental accretion, arc and back-arc magmatism with associated porphyry-style and epithermal Cu - Mo - Au deposits, Granite-related Sn - W vein deposits, Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide Cu-Zn (± Pb, Au, Ag) deposits and metamorphic Au deposits.

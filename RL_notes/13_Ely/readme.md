## General Information about the Deposit – Ely

Ely belongs to the group of porphyry ores. Porphyries are found at convergent plate margins, such as island arcs and in magmatic Andean regions. The ore deposit formed as a result of a quartz-monzonite intrusion that penetrated into the adjacent Paleozoic limestone sediments. 
In the process, ascending hydrothermal solutions transported metals.

There are two theories about the deposit formation:

The oceanic crust subducting beneath the continent melts due to heating in the contact zone with the continental crust (note: this is historic viewpoint; rather, devolatilization of subducting crust causes partial melting in the overlying astenosphere, as shown by [Richards 2021](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/18/1/130/609629/Porphyry-copper-deposit-formation-in-arcs-What-are)). These melts lead to volcanism in the overlying areas. In the contact zone of the continental plate, metal anomalies are dissolved and transported.

The other theory, which is assumed for Ely, involves metal anomalies in the oceanic crust. At a spreading center above a hot spot, anomalies form that spread outward from the center.

The oceanic crust consists of three layers: calcareous sediments, 50% sediments, and 50% basalt. After subducting beneath the continental plate and subsequent melting of the metal-rich oceanic crust, an intrusion occurred into the limestone sediments of Ely. The ore body located 2–3 km below the surface was later exposed by erosion.

**On History and Production:**

With the discovery of copper contents ranging from 2–4% in the Ruth Mine, interest in copper mining in this area was first sparked in 1902. From 1908 to 1977, 339 million tons of copper sulfide ore were mined, with an average grade of 1%.

**On the Formation of Alteration Zones:**

Laurence P. James, in his theory, initially distinguishes the area affected by metamorphism into a zone inside and outside the porphyry.

Within the porphyry, from the bottom up, lie:

* a non-altered porphyritic monzonite,

* a zone with propyllitic alteration,

* an area with biotite-orthoclase alteration,

* and a quartz-sericite alteration zone.

Above this lies an oxidation zone near the surface.
In contact with the porphyry, one finds:

* a tactite (skarn) zone,

* a silica-pyrite zone,

* and a peripheral zone.

**Polished section description (Zum Schliff):**

In general, the content of ore minerals in the polished sections is not very high.

The identification of bornite and chalcopyrite as copper-bearing phases in this section really only leads to the conclusion that these are samples from the oxidation zone. (Handwritten note: in the cementation zone! Chalcocite)

If that were not the case, chalcopyrite (originally written "Kupferglanz", corrected to "Kupferkies") would have to be found in the polished section.

The following minerals were found in the polished sections of the porphyry copper deposit:

**Pyrite:**
Large aggregates, partly formed in narrow veins, partly as scattered aggregates; often contains small aggregates of chalcopyrite, cuprite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite; small, round aggregates of pyrite are enclosed in chalcopyrite.

**Chalcopyrite:**
Partly large aggregates with enclosed pyrite, but also occurs as inclusions within pyrite; appears very clearly in the polished sections; covellite can be found on the edges or in small chalcopyrite veins.

**Pyrrhotite:**
Small round aggregates in pyrite, intergrown with chalcopyrite. Rare.

**Cuprite:**
Gray-blue, small aggregates. Partly intergrown with pyrite or chalcopyrite, partly occurring individually.

**Covellite:**
Deep blue color, strong reflection pleochroism and anisotropy; occurs as thin rims or veins in chalcopyrite.

**Leucoxene:**
Finely intergrown with rutile; alteration product of Ti-bearing minerals; ragged, frayed structure with strongly diffused internal reflections.

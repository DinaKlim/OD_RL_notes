## Nickel Sulfide Deposits. Kambalda, Australia

The Kambalda nickel sulfide deposit is located within the Yilgarn Block in Western Australia, approximately 60 km south of the town of Kalgoorlie.
The mineralization is associated with an ultramafic body that is embedded in the Kalgoorlie greenstone belt.

In 1971, 32,982 tonnes of nickel, 2,575 tonnes of copper, and 646 tonnes of cobalt were produced.

The ultramafic rock is a dark, massive serpentinite, mainly composed of serpentine, which itself is pseudomorphic after olivine, set in a matrix of clinopyroxene and amphibole.
The ultramafic body is a steeply dipping, pipe-like intrusion that extends north to northwest.
Beyond serpentine, the ultramafic rock contains varying amounts of amphiboles, talc, chlorite, carbonates, biotite, and small quantities of magnetite and chromite.

The ultramafic body is surrounded by a metabasalt composed of amphiboles and saussuritized feldspar, with variable amounts of chlorite, biotite, and carbonate.
At both the upper and lower contacts with the ultramafic body, thin, foliated and banded horizons are commonly observed.

Within the ultramafic unit, irregular bands occur that are up to 15 m thick and contain more than 50% sulfides.
The main ore mineral is pyrrhotite.

The surrounding rock units are intruded by granitic and rhyolitic bodies.

Geochronological dating indicates the ultramafic body is approximately 2,655 ± 25 million years old.

The ore bodies are located within the ultramafic unit, at the contact with the metabasalt, and in some cases also at stratigraphically higher levels, completely separated from the contact-related mineralization.

The sulfides occur both as massive bodies and as finely disseminated grains within a silicate matrix (so-called “disseminated ore”). The disseminated ore is always located at the margins of the massive mineralization; the contact between the two is sharp.

Theories about the origin of “nickel sulfide” deposits can be grouped into five categories:

Magmatic differentiation in situ from two immiscible melts: one silicate melt and one sulfide/oxide melt.

Again based on two immiscible melts, but assuming these formed at depth as separate, unmixing magmas, followed by later intrusion of the sulfide-bearing magma into the surrounding rock.

Hydrothermal activity, which causes the replacement of pre-existing minerals by sulfides (metasomatic processes).

Sulfurisation: Late-stage addition of sulfur-rich fluids or melts to a cooling magmatic body, resulting in the precipitation of iron, nickel, and copper sulfides.

Meteorite hypothesis: The sulfide ores originate from extraterrestrial material. This theory has been particularly applied to the Sudbury deposit.

The Kambalda deposit supports the theory of in situ magmatic differentiation.

In the presence of small amounts of water, immiscible melts of silicates and sulfides/oxides can form at specific temperature ranges within magmas. (See Fig. 2: Crystallization sequence from two immiscible melts.)

The separation of these phases depends on the following variables:

Sulfur partial pressure, oxygen partial pressure, total pressure, and temperature are all critical factors. If the sulfur partial pressure is sufficiently high, then nickel and copper will precipitate directly from the magma as sulfide minerals. If the sulfur content is too low, nickel will instead be incorporated into early-crystallizing olivine in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 0.5%.

Copper is highly chalcophile and is therefore incorporated only in very small amounts into oxide or silicate structures.

The oxygen partial pressure in the magma plays a decisive role in the composition of the mineral paragenesis. It controls the sulfide:oxide ratio, i.e., whether sulfide or oxide minerals will form. It also governs the metal/sulfur ratio in the primary mixed crystals, which later decompose upon cooling.

In the case of Kambalda, Australia, the metal/sulfur ratio in the magma is nearly constant. Therefore, the parageneses in "nickel sulfide" deposits are very similar across various occurrences.

The diagrammatic section illustrates cooling, separation of immiscible silicate-rich and sulfide-rich liquids, and crystallization, treated as a binary system. Point e lies close to left ordinate. Crystallization at e or g would extend over a range of temperatures. Points d and c represent approximate composition of "immiscible-silicate-sulfide" ores. (Redrawn from Hawley, Can.

# The Klipwal Deposit

The Klipwal deposit is located approximately 80 km southeast of Piet Retief in northern Zululand. It is an epigenetic gold deposit, from which 72,321 tons of ore were mined between 1898 and 1944, yielding 42,098 ounces of gold (equivalent to 5.1 g/t Au).

In 1981, the mine was reopened by Lonrho S.A. with a monthly capacity of 2,000 tons of ore. The gold is processed using the cyanide leaching method and "carbon-in-pulp" technology.

The Klipwal gold occurrence is a gold-quartz vein deposit associated with a shear zone, comparable to the Au-vein systems of the Barberton Greenstone Belt. Klipwal represents only one of several gold-bearing quartz veins (e.g., Dongas Poort and Kortnek, NNW and N of the Klipwal Mine), whose mineralization is controlled by a major regional shear zone.

The host rock is likely of Karoo age and can probably be assigned to the upper part of the Monzaan Group. The rocks within the N–S trending shear zone are extremely sheared.

The mineralized, strongly sheared zone appears in quartzite. In many cases, dominant shear structures are developed (extremely mylonitized zones and gouge).

The gold-sulfide mineralization, composed almost entirely of pyrite and arsenopyrite, primarily affects the hanging wall section of the shear zone. A characteristic feature of the sulfide-rich bands is their lateral irregularity, with frequent swelling and pinching (“pinch and swell” structures). The ore content within the bands varies from massive concentrations to more disseminated, impregnation-style mineralization.

Two types of gold ores are distinguished:

a) Vein quartz with impregnation-type pyrite-arsenopyrite mineralization, partially containing macroscopically visible gold
b) Massive ore with banded pyrite-arsenopyrite mineralization, where the gold is intergrown with the sulfides

Stupp (1984) postulates the following model for the formation of the Klipwal mineralization:

1. Formation of shear zones in quartzites and tuffs

2. Formation of the first generation of vein quartz

3. Second shearing phase

4. Sericitization and chloritization of strongly deformed rocks within the shear zone

5. Mineralization with:

* Pyrite formation and first gold deposition, with gold inclusions in pyrite

* Deposition of arsenopyrite

* Second gold precipitation: free gold and gold intergrown with arsenopyrite

6. Formation of a second generation of vein quartz

From the **reflected-light microscopic examination**, the following minerals were identified:

**Pyrite:** Forms idiomorphic to subidiomorphic crystals. Some pyrite crystals show matrix inclusions. Larger pyrite crystals often form intergrown aggregates.

**Arsenopyrite:** Forms idiomorphic to subidiomorphic crystals. Often shows intergrowths with pyrite. No inclusions observed.

**Pyrrhotite:** Occurs as inclusions in pyrite.

**Chalcopyrite:** Occurs as inclusions in pyrite.

**Gold:** Occurs as inclusions in pyrite, sometimes intergrown with pyrrhotite. Rarely found in cracks in pyrite.

**Marcasite:** Occurs as a weathering product of pyrite.

# The Klipwal Deposit

The Klipwal deposit is located approximately 80 km southeast of Piet Retief in northern Zululand. It is an epigenetic gold deposit, from which 72,321 tons of ore were mined between 1898 and 1944, yielding 42,098 ounces of gold (equivalent to 5.1 g/t Au).

In 1981, the mine was reopened by Lonrho S.A. with a monthly capacity of 2,000 tons of ore. The gold is processed using the cyanide leaching method and "carbon-in-pulp" technology.

The Klipwal gold occurrence is a gold-quartz vein deposit associated with a shear zone, comparable to the Au-vein systems of the Barberton Greenstone Belt. Klipwal represents only one of several gold-bearing quartz veins (e.g., Dongas Poort and Kortnek, NNW and N of the Klipwal Mine), whose mineralization is controlled by a major regional shear zone.

The host rock is likely of Karoo age and can probably be assigned to the upper part of the Monzaan Group. The rocks within the N–S trending shear zone are extremely sheared.

The mineralized, strongly sheared zone appears in quartzite. In many cases, dominant shear structures are developed (extremely mylonitized zones and gouge).

The gold-sulfide mineralization, composed almost entirely of pyrite and arsenopyrite, primarily affects the hanging wall section of the shear zone. A characteristic feature of the sulfide-rich bands is their lateral irregularity, with frequent swelling and pinching (“pinch and swell” structures). The ore content within the bands varies from massive concentrations to more disseminated, impregnation-style mineralization.

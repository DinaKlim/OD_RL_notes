## Bushveld (3 historic descriptions)

**Description 1. Investigation of Polished Sections of the PLATREEF (Bushveld)**

The Bushveld Igneous Complex contains the largest known platinum deposits in the world. These deposits are particularly remarkable because they form the only occurrences that are mined solely for their platinum content.

A relatively rich deposit is the Platreef, located north of Potgietersrus. In 1929, Wagner published more detailed studies about this area; therefore, the Platreef is also referred to as Wagner-Reef in older literature.

The Plat-Reef is similar to the Merensky-Reef, with which it shares some common features – a regularly layered band of the Bushveld Complex. The base of the Plat-Reef consists of harzburgite. This is followed by pegmatitic, feldspar-rich pyroxenite, which is in turn overlain by porphyritic pyroxenite. The pyroxenite layers also contain ore minerals, mainly pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, inclusions and veins, but also platinum minerals. Chromitite layers are occasionally interbedded between the pyroxenite layers. The layers run more or less parallel to the contact between the base rocks of the reef and the underlying archaic granites or metasediments of the Transvaal System, which form the basement of the complex.

Within the reef, numerous dolomitic xenoliths can be found. Since sulfide mineralization correlates with areas where the magma of the mafic Bushveld Suite transgressed over dolomite, it is assumed that the formation of the sulfides in this deposit is likely due to the interaction of the Bushveld magma with the sediments.

The Platreef reaches thicknesses of up to 200m. Mineralized sections vary in the range of 6-45m, extremely enriched layers alternating with barren sections. The average content of platinum minerals in the Platreef is about 3 g/t. Mining of this deposit began in 1929, but it ceased a few years later. Interest in this area revived in 1967; various companies, including the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, became active. It wasn't until 1980 that publications appeared reporting the resumption of platinum mining. The attractiveness of the area lies in the fact that significant ore quantities can be mined as open pit, and the copper and nickel contents of the ore exceed 50%.

Pyrrhotite FeS to Fe<sub>11</sub>S<sub>12</sub>


The grinding hardness of pyrrhotite is medium high; it is significantly higher than that of chalcopyrite but only slightly higher than that of pentlandite. The color appears light yellow to brownish-pink in polished sections; reflectance is quite high. The color changes to more and more brown after some time, which is due to oxidation. Pyrrhotite shows distinct reflection pleochroism (brown cream → reddish brown). The anisotropic effects with crossed nicols are extraordinarily strong (yellow-brown → red-brown). Noticeable are spindle-shaped exsolution lamellae of softer pyrrhotite in harder ones. The harder component is also somewhat lighter. Additionally, pyrrhotite also contains exsolutions of pentlandite and chalcopyrite.

Pentlandite (Fe, Ni)S

The grinding hardness of pentlandite is medium; it is harder than chalcopyrite and slightly softer than pyrrhotite. The cleavage parallel to (111) is sometimes quite visible in polished sections; the formation of mackinawite follows it sporadically. Pentlandite is light cream-colored with a barely noticeable brown tint. The reflectance is quite high. Pentlandite is isotropic and does not appear entirely dark under  crossed nicols. The Fe:Ni ratio is in most cases between 1:1 and 10:11; excess Fe separates as mackinawite.

Chalcopyrite CuFeS2

Chalcopyrite is medium hard. Its grinding hardness lies between galena and pyrrhotite. Chalcopyrite appears light yellow to sulfur yellow in polished sections; the reflectance of chalcopyrite is high. Reflection pleochroism is not visible; the anisotropic effects under crossed nicols are very weakly colored. In oil, they are faint but distinctly recognizable.

"Chalcopyrite-like Mineral"

A mineral intergrown with pentlandite could not be identified with certainty. Microprobe examinations indicated that it is also a Cu-Fe sulfide, but its Cu:Fe ratio is different from that of chalcopyrite, as comparison measurements against chalcopyrite showed. The Cu:Fe ratio in this mineral is about 1:4; in chalcopyrite, it varies between Cu1.05Fe0.95S2  and Cu1.02Fe0.98S2, i.e., the mineral is richer in iron and poorer in copper than chalcopyrite.

The mineral is harder than pentlandite, but whether it is harder or softer than chalcopyrite could not be measured. The color in reflected light is cream with a slight shade of green; the reflectance is approximately the same as that of pentlandite. The mineral is distinctly anisotropic (light brown → intense blue). In oil, the anisotropy is even more pronounced, and the color difference between pentlandite and the mineral becomes more apparent.

Mackinawite FeS

Mackinawite has medium-high grinding hardness. The color is light cream-white; compared to pentlandite, it is slightly darker, and compared to chalcopyrite, it is somewhat more pink. Due to its high reflection pleochroism (light cream-white → light gray with a violet tinge) and its very high anisotropy (almost pure white → dull blue-gray), it is easy to identify.

Mackinawite is a decomposition product of unstable high-temperature pyrrhotite and pentlandite. It appears in completely irregular and patchy exsolution bodies.
Ilmenite FeTiO3
Ilmenite is characterized by its very high grinding hardness. Its color in polished sections is gray-white with a brownish tint; the reflectance is moderate and reflection pleochroism is very weak in air but clearly observable in oil. Anisotropic effects are already noticeable in air (pink-brown → dark brown), and they are vivid in oil. Some ilmenites show twin lamellae. Relatively often, ilmenites with leukoxene rims can be found.

Sphalerite ZnS

The grinding hardness of sphalerite lies between that of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. Sphalerite appears light gray with a slight bluish tint in polished sections; its reflectance is low. Sphalerite is isotropic and completely dark under crossed nicols. Occasionally, distinct red internal reflections can be observed. It is an iron-rich sphalerite, as indicated by the microprobe examination.

If no internal reflections are present, a distinction from magnetite, which is only minimally darker, is possible. Since the grains occur only sporadically in the matrix and only a few are large, a distinction between sphalerite and magnetite is not possible under a light microscope.

The microprobe examination of two narrow, approximately 200µm long pure white minerals found in only one section showed that they are Pt minerals. Another pure white but isotropic mineral, initially identified as sperrylite, was determined to be galena under the microprobe.
Moncheite PtTe2
 

Moncheite is softer (?) than pentlandite. The color is white; pleochroism is only observable in oil (white → delicate light gray). The anisotropy is quite noticeable from light beige → dark brown.

## Bushveld (3 historic descriptions)

**Description 1. Investigation of Polished Sections of the PLATREEF (Bushveld)**

The Bushveld Igneous Complex contains the largest known platinum deposits in the world. These deposits are particularly remarkable because they form the only occurrences that are mined solely for their platinum content.

A relatively rich deposit is the Platreef, located north of Potgietersrus. In 1929, Wagner published more detailed studies about this area; therefore, the Platreef is also referred to as Wagner-Reef in older literature.

The Plat-Reef is similar to the Merensky-Reef, with which it shares some common features – a regularly layered band of the Bushveld Complex. The base of the Plat-Reef consists of harzburgite. This is followed by pegmatitic, feldspar-rich pyroxenite, which is in turn overlain by porphyritic pyroxenite. The pyroxenite layers also contain ore minerals, mainly pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, inclusions and veins, but also platinum minerals. Chromitite layers are occasionally interbedded between the pyroxenite layers. The layers run more or less parallel to the contact between the base rocks of the reef and the underlying archaic granites or metasediments of the Transvaal System, which form the basement of the complex.

Within the reef, numerous dolomitic xenoliths can be found. Since sulfide mineralization correlates with areas where the magma of the mafic Bushveld Suite transgressed over dolomite, it is assumed that the formation of the sulfides in this deposit is likely due to the interaction of the Bushveld magma with the sediments.

The Platreef reaches thicknesses of up to 200m. Mineralized sections vary in the range of 6-45m, extremely enriched layers alternating with barren sections. The average content of platinum minerals in the Platreef is about 3 g/t. Mining of this deposit began in 1929, but it ceased a few years later. Interest in this area revived in 1967; various companies, including the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, became active. It wasn't until 1980 that publications appeared reporting the resumption of platinum mining. The attractiveness of the area lies in the fact that significant ore quantities can be mined as open pit, and the copper and nickel contents of the ore exceed 50%.

**Pyrrhotite** FeS to Fe<sub>11</sub>S<sub>12</sub>


The grinding hardness of pyrrhotite is medium high; it is significantly higher than that of chalcopyrite but only slightly higher than that of pentlandite. The color appears light yellow to brownish-pink in polished sections; reflectance is quite high. The color changes to more and more brown after some time, which is due to oxidation. Pyrrhotite shows distinct reflection pleochroism (brown cream → reddish brown). The anisotropic effects with crossed nicols are extraordinarily strong (yellow-brown → red-brown). Noticeable are spindle-shaped exsolution lamellae of softer pyrrhotite in harder ones. The harder component is also somewhat lighter. Additionally, pyrrhotite also contains exsolutions of pentlandite and chalcopyrite.

**Pentlandite** (Fe, Ni)S

The grinding hardness of pentlandite is medium; it is harder than chalcopyrite and slightly softer than pyrrhotite. The cleavage parallel to (111) is sometimes quite visible in polished sections; the formation of mackinawite follows it sporadically. Pentlandite is light cream-colored with a barely noticeable brown tint. The reflectance is quite high. Pentlandite is isotropic and does not appear entirely dark under  crossed nicols. The Fe:Ni ratio is in most cases between 1:1 and 10:11; excess Fe separates as mackinawite.

**Chalcopyrite** CuFeS<sub>2</sub>

Chalcopyrite is medium hard. Its grinding hardness lies between galena and pyrrhotite. Chalcopyrite appears light yellow to sulfur yellow in polished sections; the reflectance of chalcopyrite is high. Reflection pleochroism is not visible; the anisotropic effects under crossed nicols are very weakly colored. In oil, they are faint but distinctly recognizable.

**"Chalcopyrite-like Mineral"**

A mineral intergrown with pentlandite could not be identified with certainty. Microprobe examinations indicated that it is also a Cu-Fe sulfide, but its Cu:Fe ratio is different from that of chalcopyrite, as comparison measurements against chalcopyrite showed. The Cu:Fe ratio in this mineral is about 1:4; in chalcopyrite, it varies between Cu<sub>1.05</sub>Fe<sub>0.95</sub>S<sub>2</sub>  and Cu<sub>1.02</sub>Fe<sub>0.98</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, i.e., the mineral is richer in iron and poorer in copper than chalcopyrite.

The mineral is harder than pentlandite, but whether it is harder or softer than chalcopyrite could not be measured. The color in reflected light is cream with a slight shade of green; the reflectance is approximately the same as that of pentlandite. The mineral is distinctly anisotropic (light brown → intense blue). In oil, the anisotropy is even more pronounced, and the color difference between pentlandite and the mineral becomes more apparent.

**Mackinawite** FeS

Mackinawite has medium-high grinding hardness. The color is light cream-white; compared to pentlandite, it is slightly darker, and compared to chalcopyrite, it is somewhat more pink. Due to its high reflection pleochroism (light cream-white → light gray with a violet tinge) and its very high anisotropy (almost pure white → dull blue-gray), it is easy to identify.

Mackinawite is a decomposition product of unstable high-temperature pyrrhotite and pentlandite. It appears in completely irregular and patchy exsolution bodies.

**Ilmenite** FeTiO<sub>3</sub>

Ilmenite is characterized by its very high grinding hardness. Its color in polished sections is gray-white with a brownish tint; the reflectance is moderate and reflection pleochroism is very weak in air but clearly observable in oil. Anisotropic effects are already noticeable in air (pink-brown → dark brown), and they are vivid in oil. Some ilmenites show twin lamellae. Relatively often, ilmenites with leukoxene rims can be found.

**Sphalerite** ZnS

The grinding hardness of sphalerite lies between that of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. Sphalerite appears light gray with a slight bluish tint in polished sections; its reflectance is low. Sphalerite is isotropic and completely dark under crossed nicols. Occasionally, distinct red internal reflections can be observed. It is an iron-rich sphalerite, as indicated by the microprobe examination.

If no internal reflections are present, a distinction from magnetite, which is only minimally darker, is possible. Since the grains occur only sporadically in the matrix and only a few are large, a distinction between sphalerite and magnetite is not possible under a light microscope.

The microprobe examination of two narrow, approximately 200µm long pure white minerals found in only one section showed that they are Pt minerals. Another pure white but isotropic mineral, initially identified as sperrylite, was determined to be galena under the microprobe.

**Moncheite** PtTe<sub>2</sub>

Moncheite is softer (?) than pentlandite. The color is white; pleochroism is only observable in oil (white → delicate light gray). The anisotropy is quite noticeable from light beige → dark brown.

**Description 2. Sulphide Ore from the Merensky Reef (Bushveld)**

The Merensky Reef was named after Dr. H. Merensky, who in 1924 was able to detect platinum in some samples from the area. The Merensky Reef is a regularly layered band of the Bushveld Intrusive Complex. It is the most significant, previously known platinum deposit in the world. It consists of pyroxenite layers, which are sometimes composed of or include thin chromitite bands. These layers further consist of scattered pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, accessory chromite, and they contain consistent contents of platinum group elements (4-15 g/t). The pyroxenite layers vary in thickness between 10 cm and 7.5 m at different locations around the Bushveld. The pyroxenite layer is overlain by a differentiated sequence consisting of norite and dispersed anorthosite. This entire sequence is again overlain by a very similar series, whose lowest layer is known as the "Bastard Reef." Additionally, a chromitite band is often found at the base; the platinum content in the Bastard Reef is very low.

The Merensky Reef shows regional differences in its characteristics. In the western part, the platinum values are concentrated in a pegmatitic phase at the base of the pyroxenite band, where the chromitite bands form the contact. In the eastern part, platinum appears in the upper porphyritic zone of the reef, in conjunction with thin chromitite bands and scattered base metal sulfides.
The silicate minerals that occur in the reef are mainly orthopyroxenes (bronzite), fewer clinopyroxenes, and subordinate plagioclase (bytownite, labradorite). Minor serpentinization of the pyroxenes occurred, releasing secondary magnetite. The most important platinum minerals found in polished sections or through microprobe examinations are braggite, cooperite, laurite, sperrylite, and Pt-Fe alloys.

The Merensky Reef was prospected over a length of 130 km in the western part and 120 km in the eastern part.
In the polished sections analyzed for this study, the following minerals were identified with the microscope: **pyrrhotite**, **chalcopyrite**, **ilmenite**, **chromite**, **pentlandite**, and **chalcopyrrhotite**.

**Ilmenite** FeTiO<sub>3</sub>

Ilmenite has very high grinding hardness; the color is gray-white with a brownish tinge, and the reflectance is moderate. The reflection pleochroism is distinctly colored from pink-brown to dark brown. In these sections, ilmenite appears in very large idiomorphic crystals, which are clearly marked by twin lamellae and the reflection pleochroism. A lattice structure is partially recognizable. At some grain boundaries, myrmekite-like reaction rims occur with the adjacent gangue.

**Pyrrhotite** FeS<sub>1−𝑥</sub>

The grinding hardness is medium high and lies between chalcopyrite and pentlandite. The color in polished sections is light yellow to brown-pink with high reflectance. The reflection pleochroism is distinctly from reddish-brown to brown cream. With crossed nicols, the colors range from yellow-gray to red-brown. Pyrrhotite shows distinct exsolution lamellae from harder pyrrhotite in softer ones. This can already be seen in individual grains due to the reflection pleochroism. The lamellae are disc-shaped and mostly darker colored than the surrounding pyrrhotite.

**Chalcopyrite** CuFeS<sub>2</sub>

The grinding hardness of chalcopyrite lies between galena and sphalerite. It appears light yellow in polished sections, highly shiny, and shows little reflection pleochroism. Anisotropic effects are weak, but they are recognizable in oil. Chalcopyrite can abundantly absorb FeS and NiS at high temperatures, assuming that it exsolves at lower temperatures. The chalcopyrite shows in these samples pink-brown, somewhat harder, isotropic exsolution lamellae, which appear darker than pyrrhotite. It is likely chalcopyrrhotite, which can occur as an exsolution in chalcopyrite.

**Chalcopyrrhotite** CuFeS<sub>2</sub> - FeS (1:1 to 1:6)

Chalcopyrrhotite has slightly higher grinding hardness than chalcopyrite. The color is similar to brownish pyrrhotite, but somewhat more leathery-colored and isotropic.

**Pentlandite** (Fe, Ni)S

Pentlandite has an exceptionally good cleavage parallel to (111) and its grinding hardness lies between that of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The color impression is light cream-colored with quite high reflectance. Pentlandite is isotropic. It occurs here both as flame-like exsolution in magnetite, as well as in large crystals.

**Chromite** FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

The grinding hardness of chromite is higher than that of magnetite, but softer than that of hematite. The color is grayish-white with a slight brown tint. It has a low reflectance (12-16%) and is completely dark (isotropic) with crossed nicols.

**Decription 3. Report on the Examination of 12 Polished Sections from the Merensky Reef (Bushveld). Author: W. Krumbe**

The samples were examined under the microscope, and the following minerals were identified:
**Ilmenite**, **Chromite**, **Pyrrhotite**, **Chalcopyrite**, **Chalcopyrrhotite**, and **Pentlandite**.

![Sketch 3](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/03_Bushveld/3%20Bushveld_sketch3.jpg)

Photographs were taken of some representative phases in air and oil. Additionally, the reflection of the minerals against Elba pyrite (section 220) was measured in monochromatic light with a wavelength of 590nm. The measurements were carried out with a micro-reflection measurement device (Microsix) connected to a Zeiss microscope.

The following reflectance values were obtained:

| Mineral       | Measured Reflectance Value | Literature Reflectance Value (590nm) |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ilmenite      | 18.7% ± 1%                | 18%                                 |
| Chromite      |                           | 15%                                 |
| Pyrrhotite    | 37.8%                     | 37%                                 |
| Chalcopyrite  | 43.7% (too high)          | 41.5%                               |
| Pentlandite   |                           | 51%                                 |

Reflectance values for Pentlandite and Chromite were not determined because the grains were not large enough and the measuring device would also have captured the edge areas.

Platinum minerals could not be found microscopically. Since site descriptions and reports on the Merensky Reef describe platinum element contents of 4-15 g/t, it is possible that 1-2 platinum grains are present in the 12 sections but could not be found.

Platinum minerals previously detected in the Merensky Reef include: **Braggite** (Pt,Pd,Ni)S, **Ferroplatinum** (Fe-Pt), **Cooperite** (PtS), **Sperrylite** (PtAs<sub>2</sub>), **Laurite** (Ru,Os,Ir)S<sub>2</sub>, and **Bismuth-telluride**.

Therefore, the sections were examined in a special preparation holder on the X-ray fluorescence device (old apparatus) for platinum, osmium, and iridium. A platinum-iron alloy was used as a comparison substance, which was recorded with the same settings. In the measurements of the 12 sections, the peaks of the tungsten cathode were very high. If platinum minerals are present in these sections, they are either overlain by W or their contents are so low that the measuring device could no longer detect them.

Another possibility to identify platinum, if present, is to investigate under the microprobe. It would also be worthwhile to examine the individual exsolution lamellae in ilmenite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite for their chemistry.

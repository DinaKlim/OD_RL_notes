![Chalcocite](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/09_Chalcocite_unknown/9%20Kupferglanz%20Unbekannt.jpg)

Legend for the Drawing

Cu₂S: Rhombic chalcocite

Cu: Native copper

A: Not determinable with reflected light microscopy?

B: Fahlore (complex sulfide mineral)? Determination uncertain (marked in blue)

G: Gangue (non-valuable minerals surrounding ore)

Texture Description

The texture is described based on the appearance of the occurring minerals.

1.) Chalcocite appearing in the polished section is exclusively coarse-grained, rhombic chalcocite. This texture becomes particularly apparent when the polished section is etched for 10 seconds with concentrated HNO₃, as shown in the drawing. All other types of chalcocite described in the literature do not appear.

2.) Native copper is frequent and occurs in large aggregates. The copper does not show any regular structure and is evenly distributed over the entire polished section image. If the polished section is etched, the copper disappears completely.

3.)+4.) In the polished section image, two closely intergrown minerals appear, whose grain size is extremely small. Therefore, no definitive optical determination is possible. The bright substance might, based on its color and isotropy, be a fahlore (complex sulfide mineral). However, the determination is uncertain (in the drawing marked in blue). For the brown substance with internal reflections, sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is suspected, which could not be confirmed by etching with bleach. A determination could be carried out using a microprobe or SEM.

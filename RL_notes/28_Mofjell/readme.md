## Mofjell / Norway

**Ore Deposit Description:**

The currently active mine is located in northern Norway, 40 km south of the Arctic Circle.
Raw ore production amounted to approx. 1.5 million tonnes up to 1964.

The mineralization consists of lens-shaped ore bodies, which are mostly concordant within the host rocks.
The average metal content is approximately:

0.47% Cu

5.00% Zn

0.81% Pb

The host rock consists of metasediments, which occur in the almandine-amphibolite facies as gneisses and amphibolites.

The main minerals are: Quartz, Feldspar, Mica, Amphibole, Kyanite, Garnet

The metal contents were precipitated during the Caledonian folding as submarine-exhalative-sedimentary deposits and were metamorphically overprinted during the orogeny.

Main ore minerals:

Magnetite --> Mg

Sphalerite --> Z

Chalcopyrite --> K

Galena --> B

Secondary minerals:

Gangue --> G

Goethite --> Go

Mackinawite --> M

Covellite --> C

Markasite

## Geological Overview

The two thin-section series come from ore deposits in the Seengebirge area between Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como.
The mountain range is composed of gneisses of unknown age. The last metamorphic overprint is older than the Westphalian.
The Caslano–Taverne dislocation zone divides the Seengebirge into two tectonically and petrographically distinct units.
The more southerly Val Colla Zone has been thrust over the Ceneri Zone along the Caslano–Taverne dislocation zone. This thrusting took place in the Late Carboniferous.

The northern Ceneri Zone consists of meso- to kata-metamorphic rocks, mainly aplite-like alkali feldspar gneisses, biotite–plagioclase–potassium feldspar gneisses (often containing hornblende), biotite–plagioclase–two-mica gneisses, biotite–plagioclase hornfels gneisses, amphibolites, and metamorphic peridotites.

The folding tectonics in the Malcantone area are overprinted by fault tectonics; the fault zones run parallel to the Caslano–Taverne dislocation zone.
The mineralization phenomena of the Malcantone are associated with this tectonic structure.   

The Val Colla Zone is composed of meso- to epimetamorphic rocks, mainly muscovite–alkali feldspar gneisses, sericite–plagioclase schist gneisses, and hornblende–epidote schists, all of which often show strong cataclasis.

The gneisses generally dip isoclinally to the southeast or south.
During the Tertiary, the fault zones of the Malcantone were reactivated by the Alpine orogeny.

The crystalline rocks south of the Tresa River are overlain by Permian tuffs, quartz porphyries, porphyries, and granophyres. Above these follow sandy–conglomeratic and dolomitic deposits of the Triassic and Liassic siliceous limestones, etc.

To the west, toward Lake Como, the volcanic rocks disappear, but east of the lake they reappear.
Permian and Mesozoic rocks were somewhat folded during the Alpine orogeny and displaced by faults.

The Mesozoic sediments are barren of ore.
Barite and fluorite veins of the volcanic series extend up into the Werfenian.

## The Ore Deposit of Ponte Aranno

The occurrence belongs to the vein-type mineralizations, which are associated with fault zones and widened fractures, and can be assigned to the paragenetic group that generally shows the presence of Sb-minerals, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, quartz, and ankerite, occasionally also characterized by barite.

The host rock is mainly sericitized and ankeritized. The Ponte Aranno vein consists of a network of quartz–barite–ankerite stringers containing sulfides and of ankerite stringers without sulfides in the host rock.

The vein thickness is a maximum of 4 meters.
The host rock is biotite–andesine gneiss containing potassium feldspar.
Paragneiss bands are embedded in north–south striking, steeply east-dipping biotite gneisses.

The vein is not associated with any major fault zone. Ponte Aranno corresponds to a northwest-striking fracture.

Three vein formation phases have been identified.

**Phases of Mineral Formation at Ponte Aranno**

**1st Phase:**

* Sericite
* Rutile
* Anatase
* Hematite
* Quartz I
* Pyrrhotite
* Pyrite I
* Chalcopyrite I

**2nd Phase:**

* Ankerite I

**3rd Phase:**

* Ankerite II
* Quartz II
* Pyrite II
* Marcasite
* Chalcopyrite II
* Sphalerite
* Galena with Tetrahedrite and Bournonite
* Barite
* Calcite

**Thin Section Description**

Sphalerite (Zinkblende):
Sphalerite makes up about 80% of the sample.
X-ray diffraction analyses show an FeS content of approximately 7 mol%.
Numerous fractured grains with fine cracks can be observed.

Pyrrhotite (Magnetkies):
Occurs as inclusions within sphalerite.

Galena (Bleiglanz):
Shows numerous characteristic cleavage fractures, clearly visible in the thin sections.

Intergrowths with chalcopyrite (Kupferkies) are common, while intergrowths with tetrahedrite (Fahlerz) are rare.
Occasionally, small flakes of marcasite are also present.

## The Erratic Ore Blocks near Pura

Erratic ore blocks of two ore types are found in the area around Pura, always at the base of fluvio-glacial deposits.
Their sizes range from nut-sized fragments to blocks weighing 1–2 tons.

Because of their poor rounding, a short transport distance is assumed, with a possible origin either from the Ceneri area west of the Vedeggio Valley or from the upper Malcantone. Determining the exact source is difficult, as no fragments of the associated host rocks have been found.

Based on paragenetic relationships, there is no clear comparison with the known occurrences in Malcantone and the Ceneri area, since in those regions, ore body thicknesses of this magnitude have never been observed, and cassiterite (SnO₂) and molybdenite (MoS₂) have not been found there so far.

According to a theory proposed by J. Burford, these ore blocks may have originated from the deposit at La Gaeta near Lake Como (Lago di Como).
However, the main argument against this theory is that no other erratic material from that region has been discovered in the area.

**Thin Section Description**

Pyrite:

Makes up about 80% of the ore minerals. The pyrite grains (0.5–2 mm) show strong cataclastic deformation in some areas, while in others, their idiomorphic shape is still preserved.
They often contain inclusions of pyrrhotite.
Replacement phenomena caused by chalcopyrite are quite common and often appear as veinlets cutting through pyrite grains.

Sphalerite (Zinkblende):

Sphalerite is the second most abundant mineral.
It shows slightly reddish internal reflections and, in many crystals, exsolution textures of chalcopyrite are visible.

Chalcopyrite (Kupferkies):

In larger crystals, deformation twins can be observed.

Pyrrhotite (Magnetkies):

Frequently present as inclusions within pyrite.

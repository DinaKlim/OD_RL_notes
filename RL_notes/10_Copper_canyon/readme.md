## Porphyry Cu ore from the Copper Canyon

The Copper Canyon deposits are located in the southeastern part of the Battle Mountain Mining District in northern central Nevada, approximately 19 km southwest of the town of Battle Mountain. 
The ore deposits are of the contact metasomatic or "wall-rock porphyry copper" type. Mining is primarily focused on copper, but significant amounts of gold and silver are also extracted.

These three metals are found in two distinct ore bodies, which were formed through thermal metamorphism, hydrothermal replacement, and the addition of sulfides.

The sulfide minerals that can occur in Copper Canyon are: pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and more rarely galena, sphalerite, marcasite, molybdenite, arsenopyrite, and covellite.
The sulfides appear as fracture fillings and occur in quartz-bearing veins.
The two ore bodies belong to the potassium-rich zone. Biotite and K feldspar occur there. The marginal area of the eastern body already belongs to the phyllite zone.

The sulfides found in the polished sections occur in decreasing frequency as follows: pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite (here always intergrown with gangue). Molybdenite only appears in tiny grains.

## Porphyry Cu ore from the Copper Canyon

The Copper Canyon deposits are located in the southeastern part of the Battle Mountain Mining District in northern central Nevada, approximately 19 km southwest of the town of Battle Mountain. 
The ore deposits are of the contact metasomatic or "wall-rock porphyry copper" type. Mining is primarily focused on copper, but significant amounts of gold and silver are also extracted.

These three metals are found in two distinct ore bodies, which were formed through thermal metamorphism, hydrothermal replacement, and the addition of sulfides.

The sulfide minerals that can occur in Copper Canyon are: pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and more rarely galena, sphalerite, marcasite, molybdenite, arsenopyrite, and covellite.
The sulfides appear as fracture fillings and occur in quartz-bearing veins.
The two ore bodies belong to the potassium-rich zone. Biotite and K feldspar occur there. The marginal area of the eastern body already belongs to the phyllite zone.

The sulfides found in the polished sections occur in decreasing frequency as follows: pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite (here always intergrown with gangue). Molybdenite only appears in tiny grains.

Pyrrhotite FeS<sub>1 - x</sub>

Pyrrhotite has medium grinding hardness (between pyrite and chalcopyrite). Its color impression ranges from light yellow to brownish-pink.
The reflectivity is relatively high, and the reflection pleochroism ranges between brownish-red and reddish-brown.

Pyrrhotite is distinctly anisotropic.

Pyrite FeS<sub>2</sub>

Pyrite has a greater hardness than most other sulfide ores.
It often exhibits a pronounced relief compared to other minerals.
The color is ligh-yellow with very high reflectivity.
Pyrite is isotropic. It also shows, as in these polished sections, a tendency toward idiomorphic growth and a tendency to enclose other foreign minerals.

Chalcopyrite CuFeS<sub>2</sub>

The grinding hardness of chalcopyrite is lower than that of pyrrhotite and higher than that of galena. Due to its widespread occurrence, it is often used for hardness determination.
The color is light yellow to sulfur-yellow.
The reflection pleochroism is barely visible, and the anisotropy effects with crossed Nicols are always weak.

Sphalerite ZnS

The grinding hardness of sphalerite is medium. ZnS is softer than pyrrhotite and harder than chalcopyrite. Sphalerite sometimes shows twin lamellae and has a very low reflectivity. Reddish-brown to yellowish internal reflections are common. The color is light gray with a very subtle bluish-brown undertone.

Molybdenite MoS<sub>2</sub>

Molybdenite has a low hardness of H=1â€“1.5 and smears relatively frequently during polishing due to its translational properties.
The grinding hardness is higher than that of galena and partially higher than that of chalcopyrite. It has a pure white high reflectivity, and its reflection pleochroism is surpassed by only a few minerals (pure white to grayish white). The anisotropy effects are strikingly high (white-gray).
Molybdenite appears here in very small quantities, but stands out clearly from the surrounding gangue due to its color and high relief.

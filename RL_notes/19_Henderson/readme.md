## Henderson, Colorado

The following minerals were found in the thin sections of the Henderson porphyry copper deposit:

Molybdenite

As gangue mineral; aggregate forms: platy, hexagonal, stalky to short-prismatic, corroded; mostly fractured and bent due to deformation; most common ore mineral.

Pyrite

Mostly small, rounded aggregates scattered between the molybdenite; occasionally large aggregates located in some concentrated spots near molybdenite veins. Rarely intergrown with rutile.

Rutile

Light gray, rounded aggregates with yellowish-red to brownish-red internal reflections; often intimately intergrown with leucoxene.

Leucoxene

Occurs either alone or intergrown with rutile.

Sphalerite

Rare. Small, rounded aggregates.

Magnetite

Extremely rare. Does not form intergrowths.

Overall, the minerals appear more frequently adjacent to the veins. The wall rock contains only sparse occurrences of ore minerals.

**General Information on the Deposit**

Henderson belongs to the group of porphyry ores. Porphyries are found at convergent plate boundaries, such as island arcs and within magmatic zones, especially in the Andes region. 
The ore body formed through the intrusion of a late Oligocene intrusion into the Precambrian Silver Plume Granite. The metal contents are approximately 0.4–0.6% copper and 0.2% molybdenum.

There are two theories regarding its formation:

The oceanic crust subducts beneath the continent and melts due to heating in the contact zone between the oceanic and continental plates. These melts lead to volcanism in the overlying regions. In this process, metal anomalies located in the contact zone of the continental plate are dissolved and transported.

The second theory—favored for Henderson—assumes that metal anomalies originate from the oceanic crust. In a spreading center (above a hot spot), such anomalies form and then migrate away from the center. The oceanic crust consists of three layers: calcareous sediments (50%), siliceous sediments (50%), and basalt (50%).

After subduction beneath the continental plate and the subsequent melting of the metal-rich oceanic crust, an intrusion into the Silver Plume Granite occurred.

The intrusion body is concave and bends downward to a depth of approximately 1066.8 meters below the surface. It typically spans 305–183 meters in width, corresponding to the curvature of the arc. The relatively compact and homogeneous ore body is found in the lower part of the Henderson granite, as well as in the contact zone to the underlying rock, where coarse-grained molybdenite appears in lens-shaped veins.

Above the ore body, pyrite dominates, while molybdenite is rare or absent. Other metals are present as magnetite, hematite, sphalerite, galena, and hubnerite, mostly found in the upper area. This zoning of the metals points to a deeper origin with an ordered formation environment.

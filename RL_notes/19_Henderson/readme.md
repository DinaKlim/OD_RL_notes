## Henderson, Colorado

The following minerals were found in the thin sections of the Henderson porphyry copper deposit:

Molybdenite

As gangue mineral; aggregate forms: platy, hexagonal, stalky to short-prismatic, corroded; mostly fractured and bent due to deformation; most common ore mineral.

Pyrite

Mostly small, rounded aggregates scattered between the molybdenite; occasionally large aggregates located in some concentrated spots near molybdenite veins. Rarely intergrown with rutile.

Rutile

Light gray, rounded aggregates with yellowish-red to brownish-red internal reflections; often intimately intergrown with leucoxene.

Leucoxene

Occurs either alone or intergrown with rutile.

Sphalerite

Rare. Small, rounded aggregates.

Magnetite

Extremely rare. Does not form intergrowths.

Overall, the minerals appear more frequently adjacent to the veins. The wall rock contains only sparse occurrences of ore minerals.

**General Information on the Deposit**

Henderson belongs to the group of porphyry ores. Porphyries are found at convergent plate boundaries, such as island arcs and within magmatic zones, especially in the Andes region. 
The ore body formed through the emplacement of a late Oligocene intrusion into the Precambrian Silver Plume Granite. The metal contents are approximately 0.4–0.6% copper and 0.2% molybdenum.

There are two theories regarding its formation:

The oceanic crust subducts beneath the continent and melts due to heating in the contact zone between the oceanic and continental plates. These melts lead to volcanism in the overlying regions (Note: same as in [Ely](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/tree/main/RL_notes/13_Ely)). In this process, metal anomalies located in the contact zone of the continental plate are dissolved and transported.

The second theory, favored for Henderson, assumes that metal anomalies originate from the oceanic crust. In a spreading center (above a hot spot), such anomalies form and then migrate away from the center. The oceanic crust consists of three layers: calcareous sediments, sediments and basalt (50/50), and basalt. 

After subduction beneath the continental plate and the subsequent melting of the metal-rich oceanic crust, an intrusion into the Silver Plume Granite occurred.

The intrusion body is concave and bends downward to a depth of approximately 1066.8 meters below the surface. It typically spans 305–183 meters in width, corresponding to the curvature of the arc. The relatively compact and homogeneous ore body is found in the lower part of the Henderson granite, as well as in the contact zone to the underlying rock, where coarse-grained molybdenite appears in lens-shaped veins.

Above the ore body, pyrite dominates, while molybdenite is rare or absent. Other metals are present as magnetite, hematite, sphalerite, galena, and hubnerite, mostly found in the upper area. This metal zoning suggests formation at greater depth under specific physicochemical conditions.
Even the rock-forming minerals in the Henderson body exhibit zoning.
From bottom to top, there is a greisen zone and an argillic alteration zone, both generally enriched in molybdenite and younger than the ore body itself. Above these follow a biotite subzone, a K-feldspar-bearing zone, a quartz-topaz zone, a sericite-quartz-pyrite zone, another argillic zone, and a propylitic zone.

McKenzie directly attributes this zonation to the mineralization stage.

**On History and Production:**

In the 19th century, no molybdenum was mined.
Only in 1914–1919 did mining of ferrimolybdenite begin at Urad. After a long pause, mining resumed at the Urad mine in 1941.
In 1964, the Henderson Mine was discovered during exploration of the Urad mine.
Based on drill samples, reserves were estimated at 303 million tons of ore with approximately 0.49% MoS₂.
In 1976, mine construction began at the Henderson Mine, which together with the Urad Mine achieved what were at the time the highest known Mo concentrations.

**Polished Section Description:**

Molybdenite is clearly enriched in small veins and has been heavily deformed tectonically.
Occasionally, molybdenite is found cut parallel to the basal plane.
It has a hexagonal shape, appears brighter, exhibits less pleochroism, is isotropic, and relatively fractured.
Additionally, molybdenite is also found in the gangue rock alongside pyrite, rutile, leucoxene, sphalerite, and magnetite.
These ore minerals occur as small aggregates dispersed in the host rock and rarely form intergrowths.
In some places, rutile alters marginally into leucoxene, while in other spots only leucoxene remains.

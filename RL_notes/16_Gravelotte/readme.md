In the pure ore zones, stibnite and berthierite occur, both with irregular grain sizes. In some polished sections, stibnite appears to be enriched relative to berthierite at the transition to the peripheral quartz.

The larger stibnite and berthierite grains partly show twin lamellae. The twinned areas intersect at oblique angles (triple junctions); the contact zones consist of fine-grained stibnite or berthierite. The pressure-induced twinning is sometimes incomplete, meaning interlocked triangular shapes are only partially visible. The intergrowth surfaces of the twins are generally wavy, which is characteristic of deformation twins.

Ullmannite occurs idiomorphically and with well-defined crystal shapes; antimony appears mainly in droplet-like forms within the ore zones, especially near the edge of the quartz, though larger grains are also present.

The adjoining quartz area is penetrated by fine-grained ore veins, which taper off further into the surrounding rock (serpentinite).

**Deposit:**

The Gravelotte deposit is one of the antimony mines of the Murchison Greenstone Belt, which consists of vertically dipping submarine volcanic rocks and sediments: carbonates, siliceous carbonates, quartzites, shales, and cherts. The strike direction is NE; the rocks are all tectonically stressed and slightly metamorphosed.

Gravelotte is hosted mainly in carbonate rocks.
The most intensely mineralized zone begins 120 meters below the surface and extends down to 420 meters.
It is 300 m long and up to 3 m wide.

The antimony deposits of the Murchison Range were formerly considered epigenetic-hydrothermal. Deep-seated granites were thought to be responsible for the ore-forming fluids.

Today, however, it is assumed that the Fe-Ni-Sb ore solutions were associated with submarine volcanism and that the rocks were already minerlalized during sedimentation.
During subsequent diagenesis and metamorphism, the ores were mobilized and re-concentrated.
This redeposition favored shear and contact zones, as well as tectonic folds.

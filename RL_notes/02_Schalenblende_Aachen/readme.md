## Schalenblende / Aachen (historic notes)
**Textural Description**
The ore is banded and consists of the following parts:

* Perpendicular to the direction of bedding, radiant **marcasite** with partially idiomorphic surfaces in the growth direction.
* **Gel-pyrite**; mostly as a rim around marcasite. Contains inclusions of hypidiomorphic marcasite and fine-grained anisotropic material.
* **Schalenblende sphalerite**; contains hypidiomorphic and xenomorphic inclusions of pyrite and galena. It becomes finely striated at the edge and over into the gangue material.
* **Gangue**; shows as banded components of different colors under crossed polars.

**Phase Composition**

(A) Marcasite: Color: white-yellow/ strongly anisotropic/ reflection pleochroism/ twinning.
VHN: 1100

(B) Gel-pyrite: Color: light yellow, varying shade/ isotropic/ VHN: varies, 700-950

(C) Galena: Color: light gray/ isotropic/ cleavage fractures. VHN: 50

(D) Sphalerite: Color: gray-blue; macroscopically: dark brown/ isotropic/ VHN: varies, 420-700
According to literature: sphalerite + wurzite

(E) Gangue: Color: without polarizer: uniformly gray-blue; with polarizer: white, ochre, brown. 
VHN: 250
According to literature, can occur: calcite, dolomite, ankerite, siderite.

**Ore Deposit Formation**

The deposit contains mesothermal to epithermal lead-zinc bodies. A relationship to a magmatic source cannot be proven. Characterized by colloidal ores. 
The mountain range is intersected by faults running perpendicular to the strike of the layers (established at the latest during the Asturian folding phase), which are exclusively mineralized where carbonate layers occur (lower Carboniferous coal limestone). By dissolving the surrounding rock from the fissures, irregularly shaped cavities and ore bodies were formed. The deposit belongs to the "Bleiberg" type.

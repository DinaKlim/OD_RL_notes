## Description of polished sections in reflected light from samples of the porphyry-copper deposit El Salvador, Chile

Section Description

In these polished sections, native copper comprise about 70%. Cu occurs either in the form of sheets or as veins and is surrounded by a rim of cuprite. This rim usually extends outward and is fused there with flakes of limonite.

As the second most common component, the section contains about 20% granular, non-lamellar chalcocite. One can distinguish purely optically between two minerals of the chalcocite-digenite group: the bluish-white, isotropic digenite and a gray-white chalcocite. According to the literature, these Cu sulfides are digenite and chalcocite-djurleite or djurleite.

Where copper appears in the form of veins, it is surrounded by narrow cuprite rims, or the copper veins are cross-cut or completely replaced by the occurrence of cuprite. As extremely rare accessory components, covellite appears in very small crystals, as well as small grains of bornite and chalcopyrite.

Description of the deposit

The deposit is located in northern Chile, approximately 800 km north of Santiago in the Atacama Desert, in the Indio-Muerto District. Host rocks of the ore are sediments and andesites of the Upper Cretaceous, which are overlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks. The formation of the deposit is associated with Tertiary volcanism, during which mainly andesite and rhyolite were erupted.

This was followed by various phases of subvolcanic intrusions of quartz porphyry (about 46 million years ago) and granodioritic porphyry (about 41 million years ago).

This youngest series of intrusions forms the main center of primary sulfide mineralization of chalcopyrite-bornite in the innermost zone, bordered by a chalcopyrite-pyrite and pyrite-only outer zone.

The economically significant ore body forms a cementation zone in which Cu sulfides are enriched. The ore body has a diameter of about 3 km, a thickness ranging from a few meters to 300 m, and an original content of 300 million tons of ore with an average of 1.6% Cu.

The enriched copper sulfides were formed by the secondary decomposition of the originally present copper minerals chalcopyrite and bornite. In this process, pyrite was only coated by the reaction products.

The ore body is overlain by a leached zone consisting of various layers. The thinnest layer consists of hematite-goethite, above which lies a significantly thicker layer predominantly composed of jarosite, which in turn is overlain by a goethite layer.

There is evidence that the jarosite-bearing top layer was formed significantly earlier than the underlying jarosite-free layer. It is assumed that at still high temperatures, acidic, hot geothermal water caused the oxidation of iron and copper and their separation. Under these conditions, jarosite formed and the mobile copper ions were precipitated as copper sulfides in a non-oxidizing environment. The lower jarosite-free layer, on the other hand, formed later through the oxidizing effect of already relatively cool, acidic waters. Both temporally separated and physically/chemically different processes contributed to the formation of the deposit.

The sample from which the polished sections considered here were prepared originates from the base of the Enrichment zone. Here, the copper lusters are replaced by typical minerals of an oxidizing environment, namely oxidized copper, cuprite, and limonite. The oxidizing effect likely came from relatively fresh, acidic groundwater, which could flow in due to the relatively high porosity of the host rock.

In arid climate zones like this one, there is no consistently stable groundwater level, but rather a fluctuation zone, in which oxidation and cementation processes occur side by side.

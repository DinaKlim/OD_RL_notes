## Blind River district, Ontario, Canada (historic notes)

**1) General Information about the Deposit in the Blind River Area**

The deposit complex of the Blind River area was discovered in 1948; the first mining operations began in 1953. The Blind River area is a fossil placer deposit of the type "quartz-pebble conglomerate," which predominantly occurs on Precambrian shields, including the Witwatersrand and Dominion Reef (both in the Republic of South Africa), Sierra de Jacobina (Brazil), Blind River/Elliot Lake (Canada).

The Blind River deposit, located on the Canadian Shield, is primarily mined for uranium, with byproducts of pyrite and gold being extracted as well.

This area is located north of Lake Huron in the Canadian province of Ontario (see figure).

Lithologically, this area is composed of highly metamorphosed basic volcanic rocks, sediments, and granites, which have been intruded by younger granites. The rocks are approximately 2.3 billion years old and belong to the Matinenda Formation (see table).

Table 1. Stratigraphic succession of the Huronian Supergroup (after Roscoe, 1969).

The lower Huronian rocks contains (gold- and) uranium-bearing quartz conglomerates (Blind River), while the middle and upper Huronian contain the rich iron ore deposits of the North American lake region.

During the Penokean orogeny (approximately 1.8 to 1.9 billion years ago), the rocks were folded. The thickness of the deposited conglomerate layers varies between 3 to 10 meters.

In the Blind River deposit, the following opaque ore minerals have been found so far: 

a) Detrital minerals: uraninite, pyrite, zircon, monazite, molybdenite, rutile, chromite, anatase, gold;

b) Authigenic minerals: chalcopyrite, galena, cubanite, sphalerite, brannerite, bismuthinite, magnetite, narcasite, sphalerite, valleriite.
The enrichment of uranium in fluvial quartz conglomerates and sands is probably due to the specific conditions of the primordial atmosphere, i.e., low oxygen levels. Fluctuations or increases in oxygen levels in the primordial atmosphere are evidenced by:

The color of the rocks: older deposits are gray-green, while the younger ones are colored red by hematite;

Uranium-thorium: In the Matinenda Formation, primarily uranium minerals were deposited, while thorium minerals were deposited in younger formations.

**2) Classification**

The minerals occurring in the "Blind River" sections are divided into detrital and authigenic.

a) Detrital minerals

**Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>)** Generally, pyrite occurs in rounded (spherical) form. Noticeable is its strong corrosion. The grain edges are bounded by numerous concave indentations, some of which extend across the entire pyrite grain, making a large grain appear as a conglomerate of many small individual grains. These indentations were formed later, as they, for example, cut through the zonal structure in pyrite.

Occasionally, spherical to oval-shaped inclusions occur in pyrite grains. These are inclusions of chalcopyrite, magnetite, and more rarely, galena.

**Cobaltite** (Kobaltglanz) CoAsS Cobaltite is very rare in the sections. It is optically characterized mainly by its white color with a pink tint. Confusion with arsenopyrite is not possible because cobaltite's anisotropy is much weaker  than the latter; it shows anomalous anisotropic effects (chessboard pattern). The rounded grain form of cobaltite is comparable to that of detrital pyrite.

**Chromite** (Fe,Mg)(Cr,Al,Fe)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Measurements of the rounded-appearing chromite indicate a zinc content of 0.4%. Magnesium is completely absent.

b) Authigenic Minerals

**Brannerite** (U,Th,Ca,SE)(Ti,Fe<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> The structure of brannerite appears as follows:

Growth from the outside to the inside (possibly reversed) occurs. The outside is a tangled, compact aggregate, followed inward by larger grains that transition into larger, well-developed crystals. Brannerite might have formed according to the Pronto reaction (according to Ramdohr): UO<sub>2</sub> + (2-3)TiO₂ ≈ UTi<sub>(2-3)</sub>O<sub>(6-8)</sub>. The numbers in parentheses indicate a varying titanium content. This reaction must take place at hydrothermal temperatures, approximately at 225-250°C (Ramdohr 1955).

**Zircon** (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>) A striking feature is the distinct zonal structure of the zircon. Microprobe measurements showed that the zircon partially exists as nearly pure ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> (no trace elements detectable); however, traces of uranium (USiO<sub>4</sub>/ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>) are also present. These are idiomorphic, zoned aggregates, with the outer edge being relatively low in uranium and the core ((U,Zr)SiO<sub>4</sub>) being relatively uranium-rich.

**Rutile** (TiO<sub>2</sub>) Rutile has a coarse-grained, streaky appearance, irregularly bounded. Part of it is overgrown with the gangue. Yellow and white internal reflections are very common.

**Covellite** (CuS) Due to its blue color, covellite is the most noticeable component of the sections. Its occurrence in the Blind River area, however, is not mentioned in the literature. In the sections, it appears relatively coarse-grained, in radiating aggregates. It is partially idiomorphic and sometimes intergrown with galena.

**Sphalerite** (ZnS) In the irregularly bounded grains of zincblende, many small, rounded inclusions of chalcopyrite can be found.

**Galena** (PbS) Galena occurs both as individual grains and intergrown with pyrite. It is sometimes intergrown with unknown gray phases.

**Xenotime** Measurements on the microprobe indicate a mineral that looks very similar to zircon, which cannot be identified in the section. It contains cerium and lanthanum in a ratio of 2:1, as well as phosphorus. It is likely a lanthanum-bearing xenotime with an approximate composition of (Ce<sub>0.7</sub>,La<sub>0.3</sub>)PO<sub>4</sub>.

Furthermore, a thorium-bearing xenotime with a cerium/lanthanum ratio of 3:1 also occurs.

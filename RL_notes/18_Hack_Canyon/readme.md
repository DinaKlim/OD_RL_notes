## HACK - CANYON - Mine

Grand Canyon, Arizona

The mine described here is located near the “Orphan Mine,” west of Grand Canyon Village in Coconino County, Arizona, USA.

The unusual structure of this deposit stands in stark contrast to the typically layered uranium ore deposits of the Colorado Plateau.

This is a so-called “collapse structure,” an almost circular, vertically standing ore body that extends from the Upper Coconino Sandstone down to the Supai Formation through the various sediments of the Colorado Plateau.

There are various ideas about the possible genesis of this deposit.

Today it is believed that this funnel-shaped collapse was caused by dissolution processes in the Redwall Limestone. The chimney could have formed through continuous subsidence due to dissolution of the limestone by ascending, warm solutions during the Mesozoic Era, or the sediments overlying the limestone collapsed into a pre-existing cavity.

For explosive volcanism or cryptovolcanic hypotheses, only indirect evidence could be cited.

Furthermore, it is argued that the chimney filling consists of local sediments, but no magmatic (eruptive) rocks and their alteration products are present, nor are there signs of breccia transported upward.

Also, the age of the deposit cannot be correlated with the Pliocene to recent volcanism of the Colorado Plateau.

The favorable structure, lithology (breccia zones and permeable sandstone), together with the reducing environment (excess of H₂S and partial dissolution of early-formed pyrite), led to the deposition of the ore minerals.

The sulfur isotope ratio shows an enrichment in S³² and a wide range of values similar to those found in normal sedimentary deposits, which contrasts with the narrow range typical of hydrothermal deposits.

The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant suggests that the fractionation of sulfur occurred at relatively low temperatures.

The last two assumptions regarding the deposition of the ore minerals and the sulfur isotope ratio are based on analogies with the Orphan Mine described in the literature.

Mineral Paragenesis

**PYRITE FeS₂**

Cubic; cleavage along {100} and {110} distinctly visible. Hardness = 6–6.5.

Polishes poorly, therefore usually remains pitted and shows high relief.

Strong reflectance (RV), color impression (FE) light whitish-yellow.

Anisotropy effects (AE) are usually not noticeable, but may occur, particularly due to incorporation of As.

Tends to form idiomorphic crystals; zoning is often visible even without etching.

**MARKASITE FeS₂**

Rhombohedral; cleavage along {101} quite distinct.

Hardness = 6–6.5; polishes with difficulty, similar to pyrite.

High reflectance.

Color impression: yellow-white with pink, next to pyrite with a greenish tint.

Reflectance pleochroism (RP) in air: clearly white to pink-brown/pale yellow-white to cream.

AE (Anisotropy effects) are very strong and form the main characteristic.

Twinning along {101} and {011} is almost always detectable.

Zoning is also common in this mineral and can often be seen even without etching.

**CHALCOPYRITE CuFeS₂**

Tetragonal. Cleavage along {201} clearly visible.

Hardness = 3.5–4.

Reflectance similar to galena;

Color: light sulfur-yellow;

RP is rarely noticeable.

AE is always weak. In the finest grains, it can be confused with native gold or millerite.

Polishes very well; cleavage is almost never observable in polished sections.

**CHALCOCITE "Cu₂S"; Cu₉S₅ ("Neodigenite")**

Cubic; blue isotropic copper luster; hardness = 2.5–3; coarse masses sometimes show clear cleavage along {111}.

Polishes easily but is often heavily scratched.

Moderate reflectance; Color impression is bluish (increases with higher CuS content);

Anomalous AE even under weak oil immersion, +N in some cases can be observed.

**ENARGITE Cu₃AsS₄ (partly <7% Sb)**

Orthorhombic. Cleavage along {110} fully developed.

Hardness = 3, polishes easily and well; moderate reflectance. 

Color: light pink-brown, but strongly influenced by the associated minerals.

RP in air is rather weak: gray-pink/pink-gray/gray-violet.

AE is strong and strikingly colorful (especially extinction colors);

Deep red internal reflections may appear.

Zoning is not visible without etching.

**COVELLITE CuS**

Hexagonal. Cleavage along {0001} very complete.

Hardness = 1.5–2.

Polishes very well despite low hardness;

Moderate reflectance;

Distinct RP;

FE: deep blue.

AE: bright orange to copper-brown.

Twinning and zoning were not observed.

Covellite is mostly idiomorphic and is considered a late formation mineral, termed idioblastic.

**TENNANTITE Cu₃AsS₃.₂₅**

cubic; cleavage - none; H = 3.5–4.5; polishes well, but may show breakouts.

Color: greenish with a slightly bluish tone; the brownish-red internal reflections are difficult to recognize.

In contrast to the grown crystals, twinning appears to be absent in the coarse aggregates. Zoning can be well developed.

**PITCHBLENDE ("U₃O₈"; UO₂–UO₃)** 

Cubic; cleavage not recognizable;

H = 3 → 6; variable polishing behavior; moderate reflectance;

Color: light gray with brown undertone, dark brown internal reflections are faintly visible.

Twinning is observable in good crystals according to the spinel law (111), but it mostly appears in grape-like, kidney-shaped, massive aggregates.

**POLISHED SECTION DESCRIPTION**

The predominant mineral in the polished section is marcasite, along with pyrite and chalcopyrite. The typical lamination of marcasite is not observable here, but it stands out clearly due to its strong anisotropy effects (AE), distinguishing it from pyrite. It exhibits the characteristic color impression (FE) of adjacent intergrowths: white with a greenish tint. 
Crystal boundaries are not visible in marcasite; it appears very “corroded,” which indicates replacement reactions and transformations. 

Frequently, grains are found whose core is marcasite, while the surrounding rim consists of pyrite. This could, however, also be due to simultaneous primary precipitation of both ores.

The pyrite, which in contrast to marcasite here contains low levels of arsenic (based on microprobe analysis), can show slight anisotropy effects, although these are usually not observable. Confusion between the two minerals can thus be ruled out.

Some idiomorphic pyrite grains, especially those isolated in the gangue (mainly quartz), show very pronounced zoning. However, due to the small size of the grains, the variability of the chemical composition of the individual zones could not be analyzed using microprobe methods.

In general, pyrite shows a strong tendency toward idiomorphic development, but this should not be interpreted as proof that it is the "oldest" ore, as pyrite also commonly appears as porphyroblasts in the rock.

In addition to these two iron sulfides, the thin section contains only one other mineral in which the element Fe is present in higher concentrations: chalcopyrite, which also marks the transition to the copper mineral paragenesis present. It rarely occurs in isolated grains but is instead closely intergrown with other copper minerals and pyrite/marcasite.

Possibly, this is the blue isotropic copper luster (chalcocite) — which occasionally appears in very large individual grains where boundary surfaces are still visible and which has formed through cementation on sulfides with lower Cu content (chalcopyrite/marcasite/pyrite), with the chalcopyrite itself also being capable of actively replacing the iron sulfides.

Always in the vicinity of these intergrowths, two more copper minerals can be found: enargite and tennantite. Microprobe analysis has clearly shown that these minerals contain only arsenic and no antimony.

Enargite, found in compact prismatic grains immediately adjacent to the other sulfides, shows early signs of replacement, as indicated by the beginning of crystal boundary dissolution. 
Since enargite is considered one of the “older” ores in the sequence of mineral precipitation, it is subject to all subsequent replacement processes. 
Thus, it can be replaced by chalcocite and covellite in particular, the latter occurring only marginally in tiny grains and likely representing a decomposition product of copper minerals itself.

In this mineral paragenesis, alongside enargite, there is another mineral that is very similar to it. Great similarity with enargite is shown by: stibioenargite ("famatinite"), luzonite, stibioluzonite, bornite, germanite, and lautite.
This mineral differs from enargite by its "radiating" prismatic structure but is otherwise identical in all characteristics. Upon closer inspection, one might get the impression that its color is slightly darker. However, since color impression is significantly influenced by associated minerals, caution is advised when judging this minor color difference.

Using microprobe analysis, only the elements Cu, As, and S could be detected in these grains, ruling out the possible minerals stibioenargite, stibioluzonite, bornite, and germanite.

Luzonite is overall lighter in color and always shows twinning lamellae, which were not observed in these grains, so it too can be excluded. The very rare lautite (CuAsS), whose general description fits quite well, has so far been observed in only a few parageneses and always as an alteration product from ged.As (likely gediegen Arsen = native arsenic).

So, the question remains open whether this is an independent mineral or just a further developmental stage of enargite, which shows a slightly different Cu-S ratio and therefore different reflectivity.

The previously mentioned tennantite, which occurs only very sporadically and then in the vicinity of enargite, had already been identified by Schneiderhöhn as an alteration product of enargite and called "green enargite".
A typical replacement process is likely not present in this transformation, as no significant amount of substance has been added or removed.
The color impression of the fahlerz (tetrahedrite-tennantite solid solution; here probably Cu-As-fahlerz) also matches that of pure Cu-As fahlerz: greenish with a slight blue tint.

![18 Hack Canyon pitchblende](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/18_Hack_Canyon/18%20Hack%20Canyon%20pitchblende.jpg)
Another mineral found in the thin section, though not part of the sulfide paragenesis, is pitchblende (uraninite). It occurs exclusively in colloform, kidney-shaped clusters, which likely formed by gel deposition. It is not intergrown with the sulfides but appears at grain boundaries of the gangue, in some cases in significant quantities.
Pitchblende can show varying shades of gray, but classification into specific uranium secondary minerals was not possible.

Very rarely, tiny grains were found that, based on their reflectivity, suggested galena and sphalerite, but cleavage or internal reflections were not visible, so definitive identification was not possible.

An attempt was made using X-ray fluorescence analysis (RFA) to detect nickel and cobalt, but the result was negative; only uranium could be identified.

## The Lüderich Mine in the Bensberg Ore District

The Lüderich lode is located in the southern part of the Bensberg ore district, between the towns of Untereschbach-Altenbrück and Hoffnungsthal, approximately 20–30 km east of Cologne.
Its length extension is about 5 km with a north-south strike and a dip of 50–70° to the east.

The footwall of the lode consists mainly of a sandy rock sequence (Wahnbach Beds, Lower Footwall Arkose),
the hanging wall of a predominantly schistose sequence (Lower Red Slate Horizon, Middle Sandstone Sequence, Upper Red Slate Horizon).

The latter (hanging wall) is to be regarded as incompetent, which explains the enrichment of ore in the faults at the boundary between footwall greywacke and hanging wall Lower Red Slate.

The veins in the entire Bensberg ore district were, according to Hesemann (1978), mineralized along the strike of the Bensberg saddle during the Bretonic folding; consequently, they were tectonically overprinted by all subsequent dislocations.

The Lüderich-Bergsegen mine is characterized by a curved shape:
The north-south-oriented general strike of the fault zone bends to the northwest in the north, and to the southwest in the south.

Wernicke (1960) interprets two systems of subsidiary faults running within this fault zone as having originated during orogenesis (mountain formation) due to compressive and tensional forces.
In the areas of greatest crustal stress, breccias formed. These were then mineralized by a deep-seated pluton and subsequently mineralized again.

This means that the ores are of magmatic and hydrothermal origin.

According to Schriel (1954), the ore deposition was post-Devonian; several deformation phases could be demonstrated
(Lehmann and Pietzner, 1970).

Mineral description:

![Luderich s1](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/26_Luderich/26%20Luderich%204%201.jpg)

**Thin section series 1:**

Sphalerite (≈50%): largest proportion of the opaque ore content; mostly occurring as xenomorphic coarse grains without exsolution structures.

Galena (≈20%): large xenomorphic grains; mainly in ZnS, but also occurring in the other ore minerals. Partly also as small xenomorphic inclusions in the matrix (then with fringed edges).

Marcasite (≈10%): frequently occurs as idiomorphic small grains, both individually and as “nests”; less often as xenomorphic single grains. Commonly as inclusions in ZnS, less frequently in PbS. Twinning is widespread.

Pyrite (≈5%): development and occurrence similar to marcasite, but more often coarse-grained xenomorphic than marcasite.

Chalcopyrite (1–5%): xenomorphic single grains; occurring in PbS, ZnS and tetrahedrite-tennantite.

Tetrahedrite-tennantite (1–5%): coarse-grained; occurring in ZnS, partly intergrown with PbS.

Gangue (~5%): only a few undisturbed remnants in ZnS, intergrown with pyrite.

**Thin Section Series 2: Mineral composition ± identical to Series 1.**

![Luderich legend](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/26_Luderich/26%20Luderich%20sketch%202%20legend.jpg)

Differences from Series 1:

Sphalerite (30–40%): together with PbS and gangue forms the main matrix. ZnS:PbS ≈ 1:1.

Galena (30–35%): more frayed grains in the gangue than in Series 1.

Marcasite (<1%)

Pyrite (<1%)

Chalcopyrite (1–5%): intergrown with all remaining minerals.

Tetrahedrite-tennantite (5–10%): larger grains compared to Series 1; not present in all thin sections.

Gangue (20–30%)

(The percentage proportion of the minerals in Thin Section Series 2 varies strongly and could therefore only be estimated imprecisely.)

## The Lead-Zinc Mine Lüderich (Bergisches Land) - later description

The Lüderich deposit is a typical example of the large number of ore occurrences in the Bensberg Pb/Zn ore district. It is assumed that the Romans had already exploited some deposits here. From around 1830, mining activity spread more intensively in the Bensberg area.

In 1975, 5,000 tons of PbS and 20,700 tons of ZnS were extracted from the Lüderich mine. On October 31, 1978, the mine was closed (due to unfavorable deposit conditions and declining metal prices).

The establishment of a new mine near the old Bensberg railway station failed because of a citizens’ initiative by the municipality of Bensberg.

**Geology:**

In the south and southwest of the Lüderich vein system, the oldest strata crop out (basal arkose + Wahnbach beds (Siegen)). The outcrop of the Bensberg beds (Emsian) follows an S-shape, caused by the anticline and syncline structures.

This is followed to the north and northeast by the synclinal systems of the Lindlar and Paffrath troughs, as well as the Remscheid beds (Emsian) and younger units.

The Lüderich vein system strikes N–S between the villages of Untereschbach–Altenbrück and Hoffnungsthal, cutting through the massif of the Lüderich mountain.

It generally dips 50–70° eastwards. Its length extension amounts to about 5 km.

**Stratigraphic Succession – Lüderich Mine Area**

| Geological Age         | Subdivision | Stratigraphic Units                          |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Middle Devonian   | (Eifel)           | Younger strata                               |
| Lower Devonian  | (Emsian)           | Hohenhöfer Beds                              |
|                         |             | Remscheid Beds                               |
| Lower Devonian  | (Emsian)          | Main Keratophyre                             |
|                         |             | Bensberg Arkose (= Hanging Arkose)           |
|                         |             | Upper Slate Horizon *(Oberer Rotschiefer)*   |
|                         |             | Middle Sandstone Sequence *(Mittlere Sandsteinfolge)* |
|                         |             | Lower Slate Horizon *(Unterer Rotschiefer)*  |
| Lower Devonian  | (Siegen)          | Basal Arkose *(Liegende Arkose)*             |
|                         |             | Wahnbach Beds *(Wahnbachschichten)*          |

The mineralization is bound to a fault zone up to 300 m wide, which was formed by the tectonics of the Bretonian folding phase.

The schistose layers of the hanging wall block in the Lüderich vein system are to be regarded as unfavorable for cavity formation (in contrast to the intervening sandstone sequences), and generally act as a barrier for mineral solutions!

This explains the ore enrichment especially in the hanging wall of the lower slate horizon.

The main ore deposition took place after the tectonic movements of the Asturian phase, with a quartz/galena/sphalerite mineralization.

After a third, rather insignificant late phase, there followed a period of thermal reactivation (re-deposition), which is associated with Mesozoic–Tertiary movements.

![Luderich sketch legend](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/26_Luderich/26%20Luderich%205%20sketch%20legend.jpg)

**Chalcopyrite (Kupferkies):**

The ore sample available for microscopy is atypical for the Lüderich lead-zinc mine. From the ore content point of view, the samples consist almost exclusively of chalcopyrite!

In the thin sections, chalcopyrite occurs in larger parts as irregular, embayed aggregates, and in smaller parts as small “islands.” Chalcopyrite is always xenomorphic in form and in places closely intergrown with the gangue.

The larger, massive ore portions often show cracks, which can be traced into the gangue.

**Pyrite:**

Pyrite, as the second most abundant ore mineral, is almost always idiomorphic and occurs as very small crystals (only a few micrometers in size).

Pyrite is found only as inclusions within chalcopyrite; i.e., the gangue is free of pyrite.

As a secondary occurrence, though rare, some small xenomorphic inclusions are present, which are again found only in chalcopyrite.

**Galena and Sphalerite:**

Galena occurs very rarely and is seen in only one of the six thin sections. It is only partly idiomorphic in form. In terms of quantity, galena content is clearly below 1 vol.%.

Small inclusions of sphalerite can be recognized in all thin sections. They are located mainly within the quartz grains or along their grain boundaries. Sphalerite is distributed much more regularly than the rarer galena.

**Fahlerz (tetrahedrite–tennantite group):**

Tetrahedrite-tennantite occurs even more rarely than galena, in the form of small, rounded particles. It is visible only directly at the edge of a galena crystal. A precise determination of the mineral (whether tetrahedrite Cu₁₂Sb₄S₁₃, tennantite Cu₁₂As₄S₁₃, or similar) was not possible.

**Gangue:**

In the samples, the quartz gangue occurs in the form of more or less irregular, lobate grains. Some of these grains are closely intergrown with chalcopyrite, while in other cases common grain boundaries with adjacent quartz grains are visible.

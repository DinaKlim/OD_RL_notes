## The Lüderich Mine in the Bensberg Ore District

The Lüderich lode is located in the southern part of the Bensberg ore district, between the towns of Untereschbach-Altenbrück and Hoffnungsthal, approximately 20–30 km east of Cologne.
Its length extension is about 5 km with a north-south strike and a dip of 50–70° to the east.

# Mining activity in the Lüderich lode:

Roman times: first exploitation of some lead-zinc ore deposits in the Bensberg ore district

From 1250: first documented mining in the Lüderich lode by the Abbey of Siegburg, later by the Cathedral Chapter of Cologne

From 1830: intensive mining activity throughout the entire Bensberg ore district

1982: end of mining in the Lüderich lode

The footwall of the lode consists mainly of a sandy rock sequence (Wahnbach Beds, Lower Footwall Arkose),
the hanging wall of a predominantly schistose sequence (Lower Red Slate Horizon, Middle Sandstone Sequence, Upper Red Slate Horizon).

The latter (hanging wall) is to be regarded as incompetent, which explains the enrichment of ore in the faults at the boundary between footwall greywacke and hanging wall Lower Red Slate.

The veins in the entire Bensberg ore district were, according to Hesemann (1978), mineralized along the strike of the Bensberg saddle during the Bretonic folding; consequently, they were tectonically overprinted by all subsequent dislocations.

The Lüderich-Bergsegen mine is characterized by a curved shape:
The north-south-oriented general strike of the fault zone bends to the northwest in the north, and to the southwest in the south.

Wernicke (1960) interprets two systems of subsidiary faults running within this fault zone as having originated during orogenesis (mountain formation) due to compressive and tensional forces.
In the areas of greatest crustal stress, breccias formed. These were then mineralized by a deep-seated pluton and subsequently mineralized again.

This means that the ores are of magmatic and hydrothermal origin.

According to Schriel (1954), the ore deposition was post-Devonian; several deformation phases could be demonstrated
(Lehmann and Pietzner, 1970).

## C3A New Consort Gold Mine (H. Duren)

**Paragenesis:**

Arsenopyrite, FeAsS: Color: yellowish white; most common mineral in the section, occurring next to the gangue of the gold-bearing minerals; in the section as larger areas or irregular patches, broken as a hard mineral due to deformation.

Pyrrhotite, FeS: Color: brownish-red; second most common mineral, occurring in irregular layers as narrow grains; due to deformation, it has “flowed around” other grains as a soft mineral; strongly intergrown with arsenopyrite and gangue.

Chalcopyrite, CuFeS₂: Color: sulfur yellow; occurs rarel, almost always intergrown with arsenopyrite, small, irregular grains;

Gold, color: yellow; occurs in arsenopyrite and in the gangue, appearing as flakes or strongly flattened grains;

Ilmenite, FeTiO₃: color: gray; as small, rounded grains, partly corroded;

Rutile, TiO₂: color: gray; as small, rounded grains.

**Overview and Stratigraphy**

The northeast of South Africa and most of Rhodesia are formed by two cratons — the Kaapvaal Craton and the Rhodesian Craton.
The Limpopo Belt separates the two.
The Greenstone Belt is surrounded by granitic rocks.
The rocks of the Barberton Mountain Land can be divided as follows:

### Swaziland System
- **Moodies Series**  
- **Fig Tree Series**  
- **Onverwacht Series**  
  - Pillows, cherts, talc–carbonate rocks  
  - Age: ~3.36 billion years  

### Onverwacht Series
- **Mafic–felsic Unit**  
- **Middle Marker** — Age: ~3.375 billion years  
- **Ultramafic Unit**

The Onverwacht Series has a minimum age of approximately 3.45 billion years and a maximum age of 3.8 billion years.

The area underwent orogeny (mountain formation) and regional metamorphism.
It is characterized by synclines, shear and fault movements, and foliation.

**Mineralization**

The Barberton Mountain Land lies outside the Witwatersrand,
the largest gold-producing region of South Africa.
Today, three mines are still in operation: Sheba, New Consort, and Fairview.

Two factors were important for the enrichment of gold:

Zones of weakness form “channels” for gold-bearing (Au-bearing) solutions.

“Barriers” (impermeable horizons) trap hydrothermal solutions.

In the Greenstone Belt, there are three types of mineralization:

a) “Sulphide-bearing gold veins”:
Formed by lateral secretion from basic country rocks, probably from the lower Onverwacht Series.
Formed during granite intrusions.
The intrusion, however, only plays an indirect role — it is not the ore-bearing agent.

Associated minerals:
Pyrite, Arsenopyrite, Pyrrhotite, Pentlandite, Chalcopyrite, Gold;
Gangue minerals: Quartz, Siderite, Ankerite, Calcite.

b) Stratiform massive sulphide deposits:
Do not form significant ore bodies.
They are closely associated with submarine acidic volcanic rocks.
Formed through submarine exhalative-sedimentary processes.

Associated minerals:
Pyrite, Arsenopyrite, Pyrrhotite, Magnetite, Chalcopyrite, Sphalerite.

c) Complex sulphide impregnations in porphyry stocks:
These are subvolcanic equivalents of type (b).

Minerals: Pyrite, Chalcopyrite, Sphalerite, Galena, Tetrahedrite, Arsenopyrite.

**New Consort Mine**

The mineralization occurred along the contact between the amphibolite schist zone and the hornfels trachyte of the Fig Tree Series, in the so-called Consort Bar.
The Consort Bar is between 2 and 25 meters thick and has the form of an overturned syncline.

In the southern part of the syncline, no ore is present.

Associated minerals:

Arsenopyrite, Pyrrhotite, Chalcopyrite, Gold, Pentlandite, Niccolite, Maucherite, Bismuth, Galena, Antimonite, Biotite, Quartz, Chlorite, Amphibole, Plagioclase, Tourmaline.

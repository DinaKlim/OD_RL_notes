## C3A New Consort Gold Mine (H. Duren)

Paragenesis:

Arsenopyrite, FeAsS: Color: yellowish white; most common mineral in the section, occurring next to the gangue of the gold-bearing minerals; in the section as larger areas or irregular patches, broken as a hard mineral due to deformation.

Pyrrhotite, FeS: Color: brownish-red; second most common mineral, occurring in irregular layers as narrow grains; due to deformation, it has “flowed around” other grains as a soft mineral; strongly intergrown with arsenopyrite and gangue.

Chalcopyrite, CuFeS₂: Color: sulfur yellow; occurs rarel, almost always intergrown with arsenopyrite, small, irregular grains;

Gold, color: yellow; occurs in arsenopyrite and in the gangue, appearing as flakes or strongly flattened grains;

Ilmenite, FeTiO₃: color: gray; as small, rounded grains, partly corroded;

Rutile, TiO₂: color: gray; as small, rounded grains.

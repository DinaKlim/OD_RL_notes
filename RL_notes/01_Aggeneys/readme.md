## Aggeneys (historic notes)
**Description of the deposit**
The Aggeneys deposits is located in the North-Western past of the Republic of South Africa, south of the Orange river.
In 1939, M. Mathias reported the Barite occurrence in the iron ore deposit located on the farms Zuurwater and Aggeneys. In the middle of Aggeney mountains, similar deposits were found where no association with barite was observed. 
In 1974 there were mapping campaigns in the region by Joubert. It was shown that the general tectonic and stratigraphic sequence established for Namaqualand could also be applied for the Aggeneys area. At the foot of the mountain range, gneiss is located, followed by amphibolite, meta-quartzite and sillimanite-biotite-schist. 
The synforms dip in the direction of East-North-East under the alluvial cover. 
In January 1972 the first reports of sulfide ore were published. The occurrences of Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag ore in 3 deposits of Aggeneys, Black Mountain, Broken Hill and Big Syn are estimated to amount to approximately 200 M metric tons.

**Thin section description**

![Aggeneys](https://github.com/DinaKlim/OD_RL_notes/blob/main/RL_notes/01_Aggeneys/1%20Aggeneys.jpg)
7 minerals are identified in the thin section, listed in approximate order of their abundance: galena, pyrite, marcasite, tennantite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite. Chalcopyrite is only present in trace amounts. 

The main component is **galena**, easily recognizable by the triangular cleavage fractures. All other minerals are included in galena.

The second main component is **pyrite**. It appears exclusively xenomorphic. Within it, sectoral divisions can be observed, which spread concentrically within the grains. At some points, the pyrite appears weakly anisotropic (it may possibly be a result of alteration).

Less frequent than pyrite but always occurring with it, **marcasite** appears. Its reflection pleochroism is very distinct. Marcasite appears exclusively in pyrite or immediately adjacent to it. 
**Tennantite** occurs as a minor component, intergrown with galena. 

Similar to marcasite in terms of grain size, but appearing more rarely, is xenomorphic **sphalerite**. The internal reflections (when viewed in oil) are distinctly blood-red, which could indicate a high content of iron. In galena, and in some places in pyrite, there are small round grains of pyrrhotite.

In conclusion: all minerals are xenomorphic. Chalcopyrite is only present as a trace component. The identified ore minerals match well with geochemical expectations, see the table above for mining and reserves. Subsequently, lead and zinc have the largest share in the mining products, however, they were discovered less frequently than expected. Primarily galena and tennantite are considered As silver carriers.

As for the literature on the Aggeneys deposit itself, apart from the numerical data mentioned above, there are no further documents or explanations about the formation of the sulfide ore body or changes in the mineralization. In a report by A. Rozendaal on the Gamsberg ore occurrence, some suggestions are made that can also apply very well to the Aggeneys ore occurrence. The ore body is part of a Precambrian volcanic-sedimentary sequence, the so-called "Bushmanland Sequence," which is located in the "Namaqua Mobile Belt" and has undergone multi-phase deformations as well as medium to high-grade metamorphism. Two alternative models of ore deposit formation are proposed

- a sedimentary depositional environment, associated with a distant island arc. 

- an intercontinental "Red Sea" depositional environment.

## PM 13 – Massive Sulfide Ore from the Girlie Mine

The deposit originates from the Rietersburg Schist Belt. It lies northwest of the Murchinson Range and is also part of an old greenstone belt.

The ores belong to the group of massive sulfide ores.
The main ore minerals present are:

* pyrite,

* chalcopyrite,

* pyrrhotite,

* and magnetite.

Subordinate amounts of arsenopyrite also occur.

The ore has been overprinted by metamorphism, leading to recrystallization and the development of the so-called crystalloblastic series. 
The crystalloblastic series means that hard minerals have a greater ability to crystallize idiomorphically than soft minerals.

Here, for example, pyrite is often idiomorphic and encloses other minerals.

Two types of magnetite occur:

a.) Inclusions in pyrite
b.) Flaky and xenomorphic grains

The pyrrhotite shows a 'bird's-eye structure'. That is, along cracks, the pyrrhotite is weathered and transformed into a mixture of marcasite and pyrite.

In massive sulfide ores, the following parageneses are distinguished:

a.) Fe
b.) Fe – Cu
c.) Fe – Cu – Zn
d.) Fe – Cu – Zn – Pb

This is a case of the Fe – Cu (b) paragenesis.

**Covellite (CuS)**
Covellite is dark indigo blue to deep cornflower blue, semi-metallic.
Reflectance behavior: Anisotropic
Structure and texture:
The crystals are platy, and the grain size varies.
Here, covellite forms through the weathering of chalcopyrite. It is a late-stage formation.

**Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)**
The crystals of magnetite are not well-formed. Cleavage (note: parting, not cleavage) is completely absent.
There are small and very large platy grains, which are xenomorphic.

Reflectance behavior:
Reflectivity is quite moderate. The initial color impression is gray with alternating slightly brownish undertones. It is isotropic.

**Pyrrhotite (FeS)**

Grown crystals of pyrrhotite are not visible.
It is very coarse-grained.

Reflectance behavior:
The color is distinctly reddish-brown.
It is strongly anisotropic.

Here, pyrrhotite is replaced by chalcopyrite, magnetite, pyrite, and other minerals.

**Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)**

Twinning in chalcopyrite is barely visible.
Grain size often varies greatly within the same specimen—sometimes quite large, sometimes tiny.
The grains are platy and xenomorphic.

Reflectance behavior:
The color is light yellow, highly lustrous.
Weakly anisotropic.

Chalcopyrite actively replaces pyrite and pyrrhotite.

**Pyrite (FeS₂)**

Pyrite shows a strong tendency toward idiomorphism.
This tendency easily produces large crystals that are either idiomorphic or xenomorphic.
This often results in a sieve-like structure due to the inclusion of all other foreign minerals (idioblast sieve). (See image)

It is very coarse-grained and xenomorphic.
Cleavage is not visible.
The color is pale yellow.
Isotropic to weakly anisotropic.

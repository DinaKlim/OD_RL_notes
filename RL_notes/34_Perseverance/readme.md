## The Sulfide Ore Deposit Chakari, Perseverance / Rhodesia

The deposit is located in the Hartley area of Rhodesia, about 16 km northwest of Chakari, at an elevation of 1036 m.

The ore body was discovered in 1964 by The Roan Selection Trust using geochemical methods.

The ore samples from the nickel deposits of Perseverance originate from the Archaean craton of Rhodesia, which is bounded in the south by the Limpopo Metamorphic Mobile Belt (early Precambrian) and in the north by the Zambezi Metamorphic Mobile Belt.

The mineralization of Perseverance occurs within a volcanic rock belonging to the Bulawayan sequence.
The Bulawayan consists of basaltic lavas and andesitic breccias, which often display pillow structures. Sedimentary layers are interbedded here.
To the northwest, these are overlain by the younger Deweras and Lomagundi formations.

The mineralization occurs as massive sulfide, disseminated, and segregated ore, and is slightly metamorphosed.
The disseminated ore is found mainly as interstitial filling, either enclosed by dunite, andesite, or dacite, which were affected by subsequent metamorphism.
The segregated ore in the hanging wall occurs in serpentinized dunite as pentlandite and chalcopyrite exsolutions from a magnetic pyrrhotite.
The sulfide ore from Perseverance consists mainly of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Small amounts of sphalerite, mackinawite, arsenopyrite, and occasionally pentlandite also occur.
The mineral grains vary in size and are irregularly distributed. They generally show xenomorphic grain shapes and are randomly oriented.

Pyrrhotite (FeS–Fe₁₁S₁₂) forms a primary exsolution with chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) and shows incipient decomposition along fissures.
At the grain boundaries between pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite, mackinawite (Fe₁₊ₓS) can be observed.

Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) occurs as an early-formed mineral (idiomorphic grain shape).
The microhardness of rutile averages VHN 877.
Twinning lamellae are often seen in chalcopyrite, but rarely in pyrrhotite.

Origin of the deposit:
The massive sulfide deposit of Perseverance is interpreted as having a volcanogenic-exhalative origin.
A syngenetic formation is accepted, while epigenetic characteristics are attributed to later metamorphic processes.

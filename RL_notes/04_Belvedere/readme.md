## Belvedere Mine, Belingwe, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) (historic notes)

The Belvedere Mine is located approximately 15 km west-southwest of Shabani in Zimbabwe and is hosted by the local Hokonui Formation. 
The Hokonui Formation belongs to the "Lower greenstones" of the Archean and was first described by Tyndale-Biscoe (1958). 
This formation consists of a steeply eastward-dipping plate with a sequence of extrusive and intrusive felsic rocks, as well as a lesser amount of not precisely defined fine-grained "greenstones". According to Hawkesworth & Bickle (1976), the age of the formation is 2620 ± 120 million years.

The sequence includes:

•	Fine-grained, often porphyritic, felsic volcanic rocks
•	Doleritic "greenstones"
•	Agglomerates
•	Massive mafic "greenstones."

Agglomerates and the less common mafic rocks form the main part of the formation. In the vicinity of the Belvedere Mine, there are also portions of felsic intrusive rocks, banded ironstones, cherts, and sericitic schists. In this contact zone, many of the occurring rocks are heavily sheared and carbonatized, with rocks at the contact directly reaching the metamorphic grade of the amphibolite facies.

The Belvedere Mine lies along several horizons of banded iron ores, described as interlayered chert-hematite-limonite rocks. The rock is composed of the following components: black and gray chert (primarily fine-grained quartz) as the matrix, with pyrite, pyrrhotite, and arsenopyrite embedded in it, along with small amounts of other sulfides or oxides and gold. The deposit was discovered in 1911, but the beginning of ore mining and gold extraction did not start until 1927. The ore extraction and gold production span several main periods:

| Year        | Activity                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1927 - 1939 | Mining and sale of oxide ores                                            |
| 1940 - 1944 | Installation of a roasting plant and mining of sulfide ores              |
|   1952      | Processing and reprocessing of residues from earlier periods             |
| from 1952   | Expansion of mining and processing capacities                            |
| from 1973   | Mining of several 10,000 tons of rock per month, resulting in about 5,000 tons of ore per month with up to 12 g of gold per ton of ore. |

According to R.P. Foster, the ore consists of the following minerals:

- Magnetite embedded in quartz-sericite bands
- Arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite
- Gold enclosed in pyrrhotite
- Chalcopyrite intergrown with pyrrhotite
- Arsenopyrite and pyrite partly enclosed in pyrrhotite

In six polished sections of ore samples from the Belvedere Mine (Sample No. BL 1), the following ore minerals were determined:

Listed in order of abundance, with grain sizes relative to each other:

**Pyrite**: Main component; massive coarse masses and idiomorphic grains often traversed by cracks.
**Pyrrhotite**: Small, rounded grains, partly intergrown with magnetite, and larger masses on cracks in pyrite.
**Magnetite**: Small grains, partly intergrown with pyrrhotite, or (rarely) pyrite.
**Chalcopyrite**: Only very few small grains, idiomorphic or enclosed in pyrrhotite.
**Arsenopyrite** and **gold** were not found.

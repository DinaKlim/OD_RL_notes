## Kurgashinkan and Uchkulach

The two deposits Kurgashinkan and Uchkulach belong to the Almalyk ore district. The area is located in the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, in the vicinity of the provincial capital Tashkent.

It is characterized by a complex geological evolution, involving various sedimentary, effusive, and intrusive rocks. A defining feature is the intense fracturing ("block structure") and hydrothermal alteration of the rocks.

The complex of sedimentary and volcanic rocks is crosscut by intrusions that formed during three different tectono-magmatic phases: Caledonian, Early Variscan, and Late Variscan. Finally, the region was overprinted by Alpine orogeny.

In the Almalyk region, copper, lead, gold, and zinc deposits dominate; turquoise, bismuth, molybdenum, and tungsten occur subordinately.

Deposits can be classified based on their genesis into three major groups:

Porphyry copper deposits

Lead-zinc skarn formations

Quartz veins (with gold, silver, bismuth, etc.)

**Kurgashinkan**

The Kurgashinkan deposit lies in the contact zone of a large remnant body of Devonian carbonate rocks, which is enclosed by a syenodioritic intrusion. At the contact, a garnet–pyroxene skarn forms within the carbonates. Skarn formation is followed by tremolitization and serpentinization. Mineralization occurred in the final stage of the hydrothermal phase, at moderate temperatures and at a moderate depth.

The ore formation process is not directly related to individual intrusions but is younger than them. The carbonate rocks, due to their magnesium content, promote ore precipitation through their chemical reactivity.

Along fractures, the host rock is penetrated by ore-bearing solutions, leading to ore deposition. The ores are of metasomatic origin. Ore enrichment is mostly associated with shear and tension fractures; less commonly, it occurs directly at the contact between the syenodiorite and the carbonate rock.

**Uchkulach**

All ore enrichments in the Uchkulach deposit are associated with a large anticlinal structure and the occurrence of an acidic effusive rock that intrudes Devonian volcanic-sedimentary rocks. The majority of economically important ores are found in the upper part of the sedimentary sequence (carbonates with admixtures of pyroclastic material).

Two types of ores can be distinguished:

"Polymetallic ores"

"Pyrite–polymetallic ores"

The majority of the mineralization belongs to the first group, with the minerals galena, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, barite, calcite, and gray ores. The dominant structures are streaky impregnations and breccias.

The "pyrite–polymetallic ores" are confined to the inner part of the deposit. These are massive ores in which pyrite predominates. Subordinate minerals include sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, barite, calcite, and dolomite. Typical structures are massive ores, speckled textures, and breccias.

While the deposit was previously thought to be hydrothermal in origin, it is now believed to be a stratiform deposit with volcanic-sedimentary mineralization. Two phases are distinguished:

1.) Sedimentary phase:

Formation of a heterogeneous, ore-bearing rock mass with initial hydrothermal-sedimentary ores.

2.) Post-sedimentary phase:

Period from the lithification (solidification) of the rock to the present.
Metamorphic processes dominate.

The metamorphic overprint of the ores is evident from:

Recrystallization of colloform pyrite-marcasite

Formation of fine, spheroidal pyrite in crystalline-granular aggregates

Healing of radial fractures and concentric zones from fine cracks through crystalline-granular pyrite formation, etc.

Also characteristic is:

Polymorphic transformation of marcasite into pyrite while retaining the typical tabular crystal habit of marcasite

Galena and sphalerite show dislocations, deformation, and plastic deformation.

1–5 = hardness scale

R.P. = internal reflections (if any)

Note on No. 1:
The sphalerite (Zn,Fe,Mn,Cd)S shows reddish internal reflections, suggesting it is rich in iron.

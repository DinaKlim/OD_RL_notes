## Palabora

The Palabora carbonatite complex is located in northeastern Transvaal (South Africa), about 350 km from Pretoria.

Palabora is a typical example of an alkali-carbonatite complex. However, it is the only known complex of this type in the world that contains sufficient copper sulfides to allow profitable mining, and it lacks an enrichment of niobium (Nb) and rare earth elements, which are otherwise typical for such complexes.

In this, the largest open-pit mine in South Africa, the following are mined:

Vermiculite (since 1946), apatite (since 1955), copper ores (since 1957), as well as uranium and thorium minerals.
Magnetite is also extracted due to its average titanium content of about 2% Ti.

Geology

The Palabora alkali ring complex is intruded into Archaean granites of the Kaapvaal Craton as an oval complex with two centers. Its age has been determined to be 2.06 billion years.

The complex extends in a northeast–southwest (NE/SW) direction for about 2 km. It is cut by vertical diabase dikes that also trend NE/SW and have been dated to 1.88 billion years.

Around the main Palabora deposit, there are numerous small intrusions and dikes of various alkali syenites (some of which are fenites), as well as carbonatite-bearing explosion breccias and lamprophyres.

The zonal structure of the complex is as follows:

Outer zone: Granite of the Kaapvaal Craton

1. Fenite
2. Syenite
3. Microcline pyroxenite
4. Diopside pyroxenite
5. Pyroxene-olivine-vermiculite/phlogopite-pegmatoid
6. Foskorite
7. Older banded carbonatite
8. Younger transgressive carbonatite
   
   (6, 7, and 8 occur only in the southern central area)

However, this structure does not correspond to the chronological sequence of the individual intrusions. The temporal sequence is:
5 / 3+4 / 1+2 / 6 / 7 / 8.

The economically significant copper and magnetite deposits are found in the **foskorite**, as well as in the **banded** and **transgressive carbonatites**.
According to isotope-geochemical studies, the carbonatites are of **magmatic origin**.

The main copper minerals are **bornite** and **chalcopyrite**.
Other associated minerals are **cubanite**, **valleriite**, **malachite**, **chalcocite** and **cuprite**. In addition to these main minerals, the following have also been identified:
Covellite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, millerite, bravoite, linnaeite, violarite, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, marcasite, gold and silver, baddeleyite, and uranothorianite.

The most important rock types:

**Foskorite** is generally a coarse-grained rock composed mainly of olivine, magnetite, apatite, vermiculite, and phlogopite.
Magnetite makes up to 50 wt.%, containing 1–3% Ti in the form of ilmenite lamellae.
Olivine is largely serpentinized.

The **older carbonatite** is white, medium- to coarse-grained, and consists mainly of calcite and magnetite.
There is a gradual transition between the carbonatite and foskorite.

The **transgressive carbonatite** formed during the last intrusion phase and is clearly distinguishable from the older carbonatite.

In the transgressive carbonatite, chalcopyrite predominates over bornite and cubanite, whereas in the older carbonatite and in the foskorite, bornite dominates over chalcopyrite.

### Thin section description

In both thin section series, only a portion of the minerals mentioned above were found.

**Foskorite samples**

The following minerals were observed: magnetite, ilmenite, chalcopyrite, bornite, valleriite, and copper glance (chalcocite).

Magnetite is the most abundant ore mineral, showing exsolution textures with ilmenite.

The samples display a higher proportion of bornite relative to chalcopyrite, consistent with the literature.
Chalcocite and valleriite are rare in the thin sections and mostly occur at the contact with the surrounding rock.

**Cubanite-rich sample**

The minerals are bornite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, pyrrhotite, magnetite, and pyrite.

Cubanite and chalcopyrite are the main minerals and are strongly intergrown.

Cubanite and pyrrhotite can be easily confused or one may be overlooked in these thin sections.

Magnetite occurs mainly within bornite, mostly in banded form, and only rarely in larger aggregates.

Pyrite is found in all thin sections, but only rarely.

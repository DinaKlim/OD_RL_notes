## Okanja

The polished section of samples from the Cu ore deposit Okanja (SWA), which lies in the oxidation zone, contains the following minerals:

Cuprite:
Occurs most frequently in the polished sections:

as massive aggregates

as fine veins
Native copper: occurs as flakes within the massive cuprite.

Limonite:
Is the second most common mineral in the polished sections. It partially surrounds the cuprite masses with a rim, but also forms the matrix in which the cuprite veins lie.

Bornite:
Occurs sporadically as inclusions in cuprite, especially at the boundary with limonite.

Hematite:
Occurs occasionally as small needle aggregates in the quartz-bearing gangue. It is visible only under crossed Nicols.

Malachite:
Occurs as massive aggregates. It is easily recognizable by its green internal reflections.

Chalcopyrite:
Occurs only once as tiny flakes within cuprite.

**General information about the oxidation zone and oxidized ores**

Through the weathering of sulfide deposits at the Earth's surface, “iron hats” (gossans) can form. This process takes place when sulfide ores are exposed by erosion and thus subjected to oxidation processes. During this, sulfides are oxidized to sulfates. From these sulfate waters, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, and other compounds of heavy metals, which are poorly soluble in surface waters, can form through interaction with the surrounding rock and with substances in the groundwater.

The depth of the oxidation zone can vary greatly. In general, the part of a deposit located within the percolation-water zone — and thus within the area exposed to free oxygen — is considered the oxidation zone. This is the section above the permanent groundwater level.

The groundwater table primarily determines the depth of the oxidation zone. Additionally, at equal groundwater depths, the duration of weathering and the metal content of the deposit play a role 
(for example, copper ores weather much more easily than galena, and in a deposit with several ore minerals, weathering occurs more easily than with a monomineralic ore).
The transition between the sulfide and oxidation zone can be sharp or gradual. A sharp transition requires a very stable groundwater level, whereas a gradual transition indicates a fluctuating one.

The compounds precipitated in the oxidation zone vary depending on the metal’s nature. Generally, the least soluble oxides of a metal dominate. However, easily soluble and even highly soluble compounds also occur, especially in arid regions.

The noble metals — gold, silver, and copper — can also occur in native form. Oxides of silver are rare; native silver and gold are common.

The most frequent compounds in the oxidation zone for major ore types are:

Iron ores: Hydroxides (brown iron ore)

Copper ores: Carbonates (malachite, azurite), oxides (cuprite)

Lead ores: Carbonates (cerussite), sulfates (anglesite)

Zinc ores: Carbonates (smithsonite)

There is also a second group of oxidized ores with more complex oxides — for example, phosphates, arsenates, chromates, antimonates, molybdates, tungstates, and uranates. These form through interaction of multiple weathering solutions.

The physical state of oxidized ores

In general: In the oxidation zone, the formation of crystal nuclei occurs both through supersaturation and through precipitation when different solutions meet.

The oxidized ores, like all minerals in the weathering zone, occur in three physical states:

**As distinctly crystalline minerals**

Condition: very slight but continuous supersaturation produces few nuclei, which continue to grow at a high growth rate.

**As cryptocrystalline, single-phase dense or earthy mineral aggregates**

Condition: strong supersaturation produces many closely spaced nuclei that grow rapidly until they collide.
Depending on the number of nuclei and the growth rate, the resulting precipitate is microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline.

**As submicroscopic, heterogeneous, dispersed, or colloidal minerals (so-called gel ores)**

Condition: very strong supersaturation causes numerous nuclei to form, which are already visible under the ultramicroscope.
These nuclei are so closely spaced that they frequently touch each other and therefore cannot continue to grow.

Texture of oxidized ores

The oxidized ores show characteristic textural features.
As a result of dissolution processes, these include:

Porous, cavernous, and drusy textures

Layered or crust textures, resulting from successive cycles of dissolution and reprecipitation

Vein structures, the most widespread texture type. These form when numerous secondary, mostly coarser-grained crystals produced by later alteration intersect and penetrate the earlier oxidation products in a network of veins.
When stronger solvents later act on such masses, the groundmass is mostly dissolved out, leaving the veins intact and producing vuggy or chambered textures.

Additionally, there are stalactitic, botryoidal (grape-like), reniform (kidney-shaped), and globular forms.
These textures are characteristic of crystallization from strongly supersaturated solutions.

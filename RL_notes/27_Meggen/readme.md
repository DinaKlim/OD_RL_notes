## Meggen deposit (Westphalia, Germany) - massive ore

**Genesis Description:**

The genesis of the Meggen deposit is essentially explained by sedimentation. The highly concentrated, colloidal solutions in the Meggen lagoon were precipitated by organic substances that released sulfur. 
These organic substances are preserved in the form of “mineralized bacteria.” (framboidal pyrite??)

The deposition itself occurred in several pulses. Each pulse deposited mainly pyrite, into which ZnS and PbS solutions subsequently intruded. This produced replacement phenomena, which are described for galena (see Texture).

**Qualitative Mineral Composition**

1.) Pyrite – (color, hardness, isotropy)

2.) Sphalerite – (color, reflectivity, hardness, isotropy, internal reflections, paragenesis)

3.) Galena – (reflectivity, cleavage breaks, hardness, polishing traces)

The marcasite described in the literature could not be found. It should have shown anisotropy under crossed polars.

Likewise, chalcopyrite could not be found. Both minerals are consistently regarded in the literature as very rare components.

**Texture Description:**

The texture is explained by the appearance of the occurring minerals.

**Pyrite:**

Pyrite shows all transitions from gel-like to idiomorphic textures. It is usually gel-like and without recognizable structure. 
It enclosed fragments of silicate rock, ZnS, and PbS. Pyrite often also appears as concretions of small spheres. 
The individual spheres are massive; sometimes silicate substance is incorporated. These were later interpreted as so-called “mineralized bacteria.”

Through slight diagenesis, large idioblasts developed, which can be hypidiomorphic to idiomorphic. They often contain unchanged inclusions of PbS and ZnS.

**Sphalerite (Zinkblende):**

It shows no optical peculiarities and usually appears in medium-grained form. 
Its appearance ranges from aggregates with incorporated “mineralized bacteria” to compact ore bands that correspond to the infiltration paths of the ore solution, often laminated and multiply layered.

Replacement features of pyrite are common. The colloidal texture of pyrite in sphalerite is recognizable only by small ore globules.

**Galena:**

It occurs only together with ZnS. Its quantity is considerably smaller. Frequently occurring flow structures and replacement features – PbS replacing ZnS and FeS₂ – indicate a high mobility of the solution. Larger aggregates often show relict inclusions of sphalerite and pyrite aggregates that were replaced by galena.

In summary, the following texture types can be distinguished:

Colloidal textures: ore sludges, ore globules, ore bands, gel textures of pyrite.

Depositional textures: banded and layered structures.

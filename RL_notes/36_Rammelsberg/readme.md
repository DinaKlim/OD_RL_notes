## Rammelsberg

The thin section series under investigation originates from the **Rammelsberg deposit**, located on the **northern edge of the Harz Mountains**, south of the city of **Goslar**.

Rammelsberg, from which the deposit takes its name, belongs to the **Upper Harz Devonian Saddle**, which extends from the Harz boundary fault between the towns of **Oker** and **Langelsheim** southwestward toward **Schulenberg** and **Lautenthal**.

The **stratigraphic succession** in the surroundings of Rammelsberg consists of:

**Upper Devonian**

* Clymenia Limestone and Cypridinia Shale
* Adorf Limestone and Büdesheim Shale

**Middle Devonian**

* Stringocephalus Limestone
* Elbingerode Shale
* Upper Clay Shale
* Upper Sandbank Shale
* Lower Clay Shale with ore layers
* Lower Sandbank Shale
* Calceola Shale

**Lower Devonian**

* Lower Speciosus Shale
* Festenburg Layers

### Genesis of the Deposit

The deposit can be classified as a submarine-hydrothermal sedimentary formation within the magmatic sequence.

The following chronological, but not compositional, phases are distinguished:

In the preliminary phase, the “Hanging Ore Deposit” was formed. After a pause, the main phase began, leading to the formation of the “New Ore Body.”

During the final development of this first main phase, a small secondary basin, separated from the main basin by a ridge, formed the Gray Ore Body (Grauerzkörper).

The second main phase led to the formation of the “Old Ore Body.”

During the Variscan orogeny, the ore body was deposited in the lower limb of an overturned saddle.
This process caused strong tectonic deformation of the ore body.
Metamorphism reached temperatures of approximately 225 °C to 250 °C (epizone).

The ore deposit consists of the “Old” and “New Ore Bodies”, as well as the smaller, intermediate Gray Ore Body.
The ore bodies are accompanied by banded ores, which can be traced over longer distances (3–5 km).
Both the compact ore and the banded ore are undoubtedly of the same origin and differ only in that, in the first, the shale substance is almost completely missing or still strongly suppressed. 

### Mineral Composition: OLD and NEW ORE BODY (after P. Ramdohr)

Common Minerals:

**Sphalerite (Zinkblende)**: often fine-grained (recrystallized), sometimes coarse (primary)

**Pyrite**: very diverse in form, sometimes zonally structured — brownish

**Marcasite**: often intergrown with pyrite, rarely idiomorphic forms

**Galena**: almost always granular (recrystallized)

**Chalcopyrite**: coarse-grained, no “sphalerite star” inclusions

**Pyrrhotite**: mostly as small tabular crystals

**Magnetite**: especially present in sphalerite-rich horizons

Rare Minerals:

**Bournonite and Fahlore (Tetrahedrite–Tennantite group)**: often as single crystals

Very Rare Minerals:

Arsenopyrite, Bismuthinite, Valleriite, Linnaeite, Gudmundite,
Molybdenite, Wolframite, Gold

The following minerals were identified in the thin sections:

S = Sericite (as gangue mineral),
Z = Sphalerite,
M = Pyrrhotite,
Bg = Galena,
K = Chalcopyrite,
V = Valleriite,
G = Gold

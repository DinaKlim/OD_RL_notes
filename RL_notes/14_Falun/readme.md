## The ore deposit of Falun (Sweden)

The sulfide ores of the Falun mine were probably formed through synsedimentary-exhalative-thermal processes. 
The surrounding rocks likely formed simultaneously with or shortly after the sulfide formation, through auto- or infiltration metasomatism.

During the Svecofennian orogeny, the rock complex underwent poly-metamorphism, which caused significant recrystallization and material redistribution.

The complex sulfide ore mainly consists of:

* magnetite,

* pyrite,

* chalcopyrite,

* sphalerite,

* galena

(Additionally, though rare: arsenopyrite, cubanite, geocronite, gold, tetrahedrite, bismuth, bismuthinite, and partially magnetite.)

The ore mineral accumulations form steep, vein-like, lens-shaped, stalk- or stock-like bodies. The veins and host rocks are quartz-bearing. Associated rocks include calcite and dolomitic marbles.

Average ore grades:

30% sulfur (S)

4% zinc (Zn)

1.5% lead (Pb)

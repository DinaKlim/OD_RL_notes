## Lornex Polished Sections

**Summary**

The Lornex Cu-Mo deposit is located in British Columbia, 42 km southeast of Ashcroft. It is a zoned, structurally controlled porphyry-type deposit in a quartz diorite (so-called Skeena Quartz Diorite, a variety of the so-called Bethlehem Phase of the Guichon Creek Batholith, age 198±8 million years).

Mineralization began around 190±4 million years ago, after the intrusion of a quartz porphyry dyke. This dyke strikes northwest and dominates the southern part of the mineralized zone. The Lornex Fold, a northward-striking, west-dipping regional structure, forms the northwestern boundary of the ore body and separates it from a younger, unmineralized granodiorite (Bethsaida Granodiorite). The mineralized zone is about 1900 m long and 500 m wide and dips 30 to 40 degrees NW according to geological evidence.

Mineralization is "fracture controlled" and commonly occurs as vein or fracture fillings.
The predominant sulfides, in order of abundance, are:
chalcopyrite, bornite, molybdenite, and pyrite.

These sulfide minerals and the zones of hydrothermal alteration are arranged in an almost concentric pattern. A bornite core zone is surrounded by chalcopyrite and molybdenite zones. Outwardly, this transitions into pyrite mineralization.
Phyllitic and argillic hydrothermal alterations dominate zones with high ore content, while propylitic alteration is found in peripheral areas with pyrite and low Cu contents. The fracture density and sulfide content increase with hydrothermal alteration.

The Lornex ore body was likely formed during the superposition of several regional structures. Under tectonic pressure, conjugate shear zones developed, which were subsequently mineralized by penetrating hydrothermal fluids.
Renewed tectonic forces caused fracturing, faulting, and tilting of the mineralized zone along the Lornex Fold.
After the relaxation of these forces, further folding and fracturing occurred on a smaller scale.


**Ore Mineral Paragenesis**

The dominant minerals are chalcopyrite and bornite (approx. 8:2 ratio),
Subordinate occurrences of sphalerite, occasional molybdenite, and traces of galena are also observed.
The gangue mineral is mainly quartz.

**CHALCOPYRITE** (CuFeS₂; 4̅2m, tetragonal):

High reflectance, intense brassy-yellow color

No reflectance pleochroism is observed

Anisotropy: noticeable under +N, intergrown grains are well distinguishable

Polish/scratch hardness: > Bornite, visible on relief and scratches

Texture: grains intergrown with each other; grain size fairly uniform

Grain boundaries against bornite are rounded

Against gangue, partially exhibits morphological surfaces

**BORNITE** (Cu₃FeS₄ – Cu₅FeS₄; 4̅2m, tetragonal):

Moderate reflectance, lower than chalcopyrite

Intense pinkish-brown color, sometimes with blue tinge

No pleochroism or anisotropy effects observed

Polish/scratch hardness: < Chalcopyrite, visible on relief and scratches

Texture: in chalcopyrite, only rounded grain boundaries

Morphological surfaces occasionally against gangue

Replacement textures/decomposition structures seen at a few spots:

Bornite replaces chalcopyrite

Chalcopyrite spindle textures (~1/100)

Myremkitic intergrowths of bornite and chalcopyrite

**SPHALERITE** (ZnS; 4̅3m, cubic):

Low reflectivity, strongly reduced in oil, light gray color

Polishing hardness higher than chalcopyrite; visible at scratches

Abundant yellow-brown to brown internal reflections

No exsolution of sphalerite in chalcopyrite

**MOLYBDENITE** (MoS₂; 6/m mm, hexagonal):

Very high reflectivity (less than chalcopyrite), depending on section: pure white to grayish white

Extremely high reflectivity pleochroism; very strong anisotropy effects

No visible pleochroism

Intense blue-violet color under weak rotation of the +N analyzer

Scratch hardness very low (less than galena); scratches smear under polishing

Grain shape: narrow blades, rarely hexagonal flakes

Occurs in small sizes in gangue and in chalcopyrite, partially bent and "undulose" (wavy) extinction

**GALENA** (PbS; m3m, cubic):

High reflectivity, pure white color

Very low polishing/scratch hardness

Characteristic triangular cleavage breaks

Occurs in tiny cubes

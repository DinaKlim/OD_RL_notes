## Kotalathi, Finland

The ore bodies of Kotalathi are located in complex formations enclosed within steeply dipping gneisses. Pegmatitic and amphibolitic bodies intersect the gneisses and brecciate the ore-bearing lithologies. 
The ore bodies consist of an intense mixture of finely disseminated perknite (amphibole - pyroxene rock), peridotite, and gabbro, as well as barren pegmatitic and amphibolitic rocks that have been overprinted by massive sulfide ore bodies.

An exception is an ore lens completely enclosed within schists, without any apparent relationship to the basic bodies.

**Description:**

The following minerals were identified in polished sections: pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, and ilmenite.

**Pyrrhotite:**

Forms the main mass of the ore.
Spindle- and flame-shaped exsolution bodies of pentlandite can be observed within the pyrrhotite. These exsolution bodies are irregularly distributed and enriched only along cracks. Twinning structures caused by pressure are present, which may indicate a metamorphic overprint of the deposit.

**Pentlandite:**

Pentlandite grains exhibit excellent octahedral cleavage.
Pentlandite is observed in the following textural positions:

    a. Pentlandite occurs as exsolution bodies in pyrrhotite.
    b. Idiomorphic pentlandite grains show indications of an octahedral form.
    c. Eventually, pentlandite forms bands and wedge-shaped intergrowths between pyrrhotite grains.

**Chalcopyrite:**

Very small, xenomorphic forms of chalcopyrite are present in pentlandite and in the gangue.

**Magnetite:**

Magnetite grains are rare; they are rounded and weakly anisotropic.

**Ilmenite:**

The ilmenite grains are morphologically very similar to magnetite grains and can easily be mistaken for them; however, they differ in color, anisotropy, and reflection pleochroism from magnetite.

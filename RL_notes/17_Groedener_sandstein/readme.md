## Grödener Sandstone

The "Grödener Sandstone" consists of red and gray sandstones that were deposited under fluvial conditions during arid climatic phases ("red bed" sediments). Stratigraphically, the Grödener sandstone layers are located in the Middle Permian (Kazanian). Overlying them are marine Bellerophon beds or Permian dolomites. Underlying them is the Bozen volcanic complex and the "Tarvis Breccia".

Geographically, the Grödener Sandstone is exposed in the Eastern Alps (Dolomites, Karawanks).

Formation of the Deposit:
In the studied area, covering 400 km² (northeast of Bozen), there is evidence of a fluvial paleodrainage system with decreasing topographic gradient from NE to SW.
In the same direction, the lithofacies of the sandstone changes: while coarse conglomerates and fanglomerates were deposited in the northeast, grain size decreases toward the southwest, and the rivers meandered more.

Within the sandstone layers, numerous plant remains and coal lenses are present.

The deposition of the sandstone was interrupted by short-term transgressions, which led to the formation of rock salt and sabkha gypsum.

Mineralization began with the onset of diagenesis.
Through the dissolution of chlorides and sulfates in shallow groundwater, this saline groundwater was able to dissolve and transport metals contained in the sandstone.

Due to the organic remains and coal lenses present in the sediment, a locally reducing environment formed with the development of H₂S, which led to the precipitation of Pb, Zn, Cu, Sb, and Fe sulfides.
Uranium was precipitated as UO₂ or bound in organic complexes.

Ore enrichment was greatest in the distal area of the drainage system (to the SW), where the groundwater flow velocity decreased due to a diminishing slope.

Mineralizations are found exclusively in gray, medium- to fine-grained sandstones, mostly in "channel fills."

The ore concentrations are bed-bound, lenticular, and limited in size (a few meters).
Only in a few small mines was Cu and subordinately Pb, Zn mined—e.g., near Radein (copper ore).
The best-known outcrop is Bletterbach near Aldein.

Pyrite, and more rarely galena, completely fill the cells of carbonized plant remains. In damaged cell areas, pyrite also crystallized idiomorphically in cubes. Galena generally covers large areas in the polished section, where it encloses grains of sphalerite.

Sphalerite is found exclusively within galena; its internal reflections are nearly white (indicating low Fe content).
The distinctly greenish tetrahedrite is either enclosed together with sphalerite in galena or found at the grain boundaries of pyrite.

Marcasite appears only sporadically, intergrown with pyrite.
Covellite is found only at the edge of one polished section, adjacent to galena.

Grödener Sandstone
The "Grödener Sandstone" consists of red and gray sandstones that were deposited under fluvial conditions during arid climatic phases ("red bed" sediments). Stratigraphically, the Grödener sandstone layers are located in the Middle Permian (Kazanian). Overlying them are marine Bellerophon beds or Permian dolomites. Underlying them is the Bozen volcanic complex and the "Tarvis Breccia".

Geographically, the Grödener Sandstone is exposed in the Eastern Alps (Dolomites, Karawanks).

Formation of the Deposit:
In the studied area, covering 400 km² (northeast of Bozen), there is evidence of a fluvial paleodrainage system with decreasing topographic gradient from NE to SW.
In the same direction, the lithofacies of the sandstone changes: while coarse conglomerates and fanglomerates were deposited in the northeast, grain size decreases toward the southwest, and the rivers meandered more.

Within the sandstone layers, numerous plant remains and coal lenses are present.

Polished Section Description

Pyrite is the most common ore mineral in all polished sections.
In the Witwatersrand system, three types of pyrite occur:

Rounded (detrital) and compact

Idiomorphic and compact

Porous

The porous type is absent here. Pyrite often carries drop-shaped "inclusions": chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, and sphalerite.


Pyrite is often cataclastically fragmented or at least shows cracks and continuous dislocations, which are accompanied by very fine magnetite lamellae. 
Corroded grain edges are clearly and frequently observed; pyrite is corroded, and in part, magnetite forms. The transformation of pyrite edges to magnetite is often and clearly observable.

Magnetite often forms as a reaction product of pyrite. However, it is also present as a so-called primary inclusion in pyrite. It is intergrown with chalcopyrite and sometimes contains the typical flame exsolution of pentlandite. 
The fine, nearly white needles appear at the grain boundaries of rutile and occur together with a gray phase x (uranium-bearing leucoxene or brannerite?). The anisotropy of the needles is difficult to recognize.

Rutile cannot be microscopically distinguished from anatase or brookite. There are atoll-shaped and rounded, detrital grains of rutile. The internal reflections are typically white, yellow, and red.

Chalcopyrite occurs intimately intergrown with magnetite. In some pyrite grains, it appears as small circles and droplets as so-called primary inclusions.

Pentlandite appears as a characteristic flame exsolution in magnetite but is also associated with arsenopyrite, magnetite, and galena in one grain.

Arsenopyrite, in detrital rounded grain form, is rarely present.

Galena and Sphalerite are found as so-called primary inclusions in pyrite but also occasionally in the matrix. They are always xenomorphic.

## The Dominion Reef Group (DRG)

The Dominion Reef system is located in western Transvaal, South Africa. The DRG consists of continental clastic sediments and volcanics. It is a precursor to the Witwatersrand system (WWRS), 
which represents a vast sedimentary basin, primarily composed of non-volcanic sediments, mainly fine to coarse clastic sediments. It is divided into an upper and lower section.

The DRG lies discordantly on granites (see map). This granitic basement is 3000 million years old.
The DRG contains a basal conglomerate (fossil placers of uranium and gold), primarily volcanics with intermediate to acidic characteristics.

The four spatially separated parts of the DRG are:

The Afrikander Lease Area, which forms a displacement of approximately 7 km,
The Dominion Reef Area, a quasi-synclinal structure that dips to the southwest,
The Vlakfontein Area, which is almost entirely covered by lavas,

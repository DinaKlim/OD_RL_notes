## Bleikvassli Deposit (Norway)

**Description of the deposit**
The Bleikvassli Mine is located in Nordland, Norway at 65° 50' north latitude and 13° 50' east longitude on the west slope of the Kongsfjell.

Geologically speaking, this area belongs to the Rödingfjell cover. It has a Cambro-Silurian age and is classified as a high-metamorphic unit pushed southeastward over the low-metamorphic schist of the Seve cover. The Kongsfjell group, in which the mineralization occurs, consists of garnet-mica schist, quartz-muscovite schist, feldspar quartzites, amphibolites, and granite rocks.
Garnet mica schists are former pelites that, due to the occurrence of basic accessory components, exhibit a high content of magnesium and iron.
Typical minerals are: kyanite, garnet, epidote, zoisite group, muscovite, biotite, quartz, and zoned plagioclase.
The polysulfide deposit of Bleikvassli is intercalated into the garnet mica schist formation together with quartzitic and graphitic horizons.
The contact between the country rock and the ore body is distinctly marked as a sharp boundary. The ore body, consisting of massive sulfide ore, essentially comprises interlinked and branched flat plates or lenses. The average extent of the ore lenses along the dip direction is 20-25 meters, and the thickness of individual ore lenses is approximately 10-15 meters.

Genesis: For the genesis of the Bleikvassli deposit, two models are discussed (Vokes, 1966):

a) A syntectonic, epigenetic deposition of sulfides

b) A pre-metamorphic, syngenetic, or diagenetic deposition of sulfides

The ore is generally referred to as massive lead-zinc-copper ore, and the proportion of gangue varies greatly but is always below 40%. A lead enrichment in mineable concentration in the hanging wall of the ore body, according to Vokes, is attributed to an additional phase of mineralization. The predominantly medium-grained (0.2-4.0 mm) sulfide ore exhibits a homogeneous texture and consists of two ore types: namely, the more frequently occurring pyritic ore type, consisting of pyrite, sphalerite, and galena with a small proportion of pyrrhotite, and the less frequently occurring pyrrhotite-rich ore type, which mainly consists of pyrrhotite, with more or less equal proportions of sphalerite and galena.
Pyrite is mostly found in xenomorphic form, but sometimes also in idiomorphic form; all other ores are mainly found in xenomorphic form.

Ores found in the polished sections:

a) Main components

Py: Pyrite, FeS<sub>2</sub>, partly idiomorph = 30%

sph: Sphalerite (zinc blende), ZnS, xenomorph = 25%

cpy: Chalcopyrite (copper pyrite), CuFeS<sub>2</sub>, xenomorph = 10%

po: Pyrrhotite (magnetic pyrite), Fe<sub>1-x</sub>S, xenomorph = 10%
gal: Galena (lead glance), PbS, xenomorph = 5%

b) Secondary components

te: Tetrahedrite (gray copper ore), Cu<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>3-4</sub>, found exclusively as inclusions in galena.
mo: Molybdenite, MoS<sub>2</sub>, as needle-like crystals in gangue
ga: Gangue (probably amphibole)

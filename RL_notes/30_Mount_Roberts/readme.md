## Mount Roberts - Potgietersrus, South Africa

Mineral composition:

1. Pyrite is the most common mineral in all polished sections and occurs in very different forms:

a) Rounded pyrite crystals
Here, crystals appear that are uniform, have few or no inclusions, and others that show a very porous structure. These aggregates are sometimes strongly cataclastically fractured. Often these structures are so extensive that one speaks of pyrite concretions. These pyrites are often slightly anisotropic.

b) Idiomorphic to hypidiomorphic pyrites
The grains are compact to porous. In the porous ones, growth zones can be recognized, showing an old rounded core and a newly formed shell. These growth zones may be compact or porous.

c) Xenomorphic pyrite
Pyrite occurs as filling material in cracks of the other minerals and the matrix.

2. Rutile is the second most common mineral. It relatively rarely shows the typical twin lamellae, but occurs abundantly as a component of leucoxene. Under crossed nicols, it appears with light yellow to light brown internal reflections. In one section, the lattice structure of the former ilmenite can be seen very clearly.

3. Chromite shows (similar to pyrite) rounded grains that are sometimes cataclastically fractured.

4. Magnetite is rare and occurs in the same way as chromite.

5. Molybdenite is present in several sections and stands out due to its strong reflection pleochroism. The platy aggregates are sometimes arranged in a slightly rotated fashion.

6. Chalcopyrite inclusions occur within pyrite.

7. Gold is present in a few sections as small, rounded grains.

8. Uraninite? Very tough, hardness not determinable.

**Genesis**

This rock is a pyrite sandstone that was later overprinted by metamorphism. Since rounded molybdenite is still present, the transport of the pebbles cannot have occured over a very long distance. In addition to detrital pyrite, authigenic pyrite also occurs. Sometimes, new growth zones can be distinguished from old cores. Because the formation of a pyrite sandstone can only take place under reducing conditions, its origin must be dated to the early Precambrian (approximately 3200 million years).

## Pyrargyrite

**Pb-Zn Vein Deposit Ramsbeck / Sauerland**

The veins of Ramsbeck are located in Devonian clay slates, quartzitic rocks (greywackes), and occasionally in diabases.
The 14 × 12 km wide vein field, due to special folding, is strongly fractured and overthrust, with varying displacements up to 100 m. It is intensely faulted, forming gently dipping, more or less step-like fissures running in an east-northeast direction.

The filling of these fissures by hydrothermal solutions occurred in **two phases**:

1. A **mesothermal quartz–siderite–pyrite–arsenopyrite–quartz mineralization** as a pre-phase.
2. An **epithermal main phase** of Asturian age with **quartz, sphalerite, galena**, and a little **chalcopyrite**, which is nest-like in occurrence.

The **gangue minerals** are quartz, siderite, barite, dolomite, and calcite.
The fissure fillings measure **3–5 cm for galena** and **9–12 cm for sphalerite**.
The **silver content in galena** is between **0.027–0.065%.**

### Thin Section Description

The main ore is **pyrargyrite (Ag₃SbS₃)** with numerous **dark carmine-red internal reflections** and **twinning lamellae**.
It is often intergrown with **galena**, which in turn locally encloses a very similar mineral.
This mineral could be **ullmannite, gersdorffite, violarite, or a member of the cobalt–nickel series**.
It differs from galena by a **slight grayish tint** and **higher hardness**.

Less common is **pyrite**. In some pyrite grains, a similar **marcasite inclusion** is found, recognizable by its strong anisotropy.
Less frequent are **chalcopyrite** and **sphalerite**.
In some sections, rare **gold-yellow, distinctly anisotropic millerite needles** appear in calcite gangue.

Based on microprobe measurements, the identification of these minerals was confirmed.
The galena intergrowths contain grains of **ullmannite, gersdorffite, violarite**, or **linnaeite**, though they were too small for exact analysis.

### Ramsbeck, Lead-Zinc Ore Deposit in the Sauerland (older description)

The Ramsbeck ore district extends for about 15 km between the Hennetal valley in the west (Mt. Bödefeld) and the Gierskopptal valley in the east (Mt. Brilon).

Mining has been carried out here for more than four hundred years because of the silver-rich galena. In the last 120 years, 750,000 tons of metal were extracted from the mine.
The mine was closed in 1975 due to unfavorable conditions and falling metal prices, and it was converted into a show mine.

### Geology

The genesis of the deposit is causally connected with the course of tectonic processes. The best ore mineralization occurs in the so-called Ramsbeck beds (rock layers of the Middle Devonian):

Ramsbeck main quartzite (quartzite–sericite–quartzite)

Upper crinoid shale (calcareous)

Upper clay-shale–quartzite horizon

Of these, the quartzitic layers were especially suitable for the opening of vein fissures.

Scherp (1958) distinguishes three phases of ore formation.

a) A cata- to mesothermal pre-phase, presumably of Bretonnian age, with a quartz–siderite–pyrite–arsenopyrite mineralisation.
The deposition of these ore solutions took place in the veins that formed during the tectonic stress of the host rock during the Variscan folding.

b) The epi- to mesothermal main phase, with a quartz–galena–sphalerite–chalcopyrite mineralisation of Asturian age.
It was interrupted by the formation of the so-called “dense ores” (“Dichterze”), which developed through very shallow overthrust movements, and was divided into two sections.

Only the mineralisation of this phase proved to be economically exploitable.

c) A telethermal late phase of Tertiary age, which is responsible for the mineralisation of cross-fractures. This mineralisation is attributed to an ascending mobilisation from deeper-lying Devonian, stratabound lead–zinc ores.

## Polished section description

**Sphalerite (zincblende):**

All samples available consist mainly of sphalerite and galena, which are intimately intergrown with each other. Sphalerite makes up the largest proportion of the ore minerals. As the groundmass of the ore, it encloses all other mineral components. Internal reflections are only rarely observed. Conspicuous are the numerous disturbance features and breakouts in the sphalerite.

**Galena:**

In the polished sections, galena is the mineral with the highest reflectivity (next to chalcopyrite).
It often shows triangular cleavage breakouts.
The individual grains have only small size (Ø a few µm, some somewhat larger) and are developed in a xenomorphic form.

Not only with sphalerite, but also with the gangue, galena is partially intensely intergrown.

**Pyrite:**

The pyrite grains occur in very different sizes. Individual crystals, a few millimetres in size, show corrosion features at their edges and are often strongly fractured. At the fracture surfaces, sphalerite replaces the pyrite.

More frequent than the rare large crystals are small, idiomorphically developed pyrite crystals, which are always enclosed by sphalerite.

**Chalcopyrite:**

In terms of quantity, chalcopyrite plays a subordinate role (less than 1 vol%). It occurs characteristically as small exsolution blebs within the sphalerite. Larger aggregates do not occur.

**Jamesonite (Pb₄FeSb₂S₈):**

Even rarer, but more conspicuous than chalcopyrite because of its strong anisotropy, is jamesonite. It is frequently developed as streaky aggregates and is usually found in direct association with galena. However, jamesonite also forms grain boundaries with the gangue.

The identification of the mineral interpreted here as jamesonite is not unequivocal with certainty; differentiation from boulangerite (Pb₅Sb₄S₁₁) was not straightforward.

Jamesonite was found in only two out of six samples.

**Gangue (Quartz, Carbonate):**

The quartz crystals occur in a wide range of sizes, ranging from a few micrometers up to a few millimeters.

The lobate and/or tooth-like boundaries between the individual gangue grains and the ore minerals, as well as the very fine quartz particles occurring within the ore, additionally impair ore processing. It was determined that even at the smallest grain sizes, it was not possible to obtain even approximately pure ore.

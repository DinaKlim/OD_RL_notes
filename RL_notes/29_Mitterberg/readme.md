## Mitterberg, Salzburg

The examination of the 6 polished sections showed:
Well-formed crystals of chalcopyrite and gersdorffite occur in equal proportions. Once, pyrite inclusions in chalcopyrite were observed.

**Genesis:**

This is a mesohydrothermal mineralization in the Permian with later mobilization of the Permian ores. Three mineralization generations are distinguished:

In Zone I and II, high-temperature chalcopyrite occurs. Between II and III, diabase intrusions took place. In Zone I, the following minerals were also identified for the first time:
Ullmannite, Maucherite, Skutterudite, Millerite.

To this day, this deposit represents the largest chalcopyrite deposit in Austria.


| **I**        | **II**      | **III**      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Ankerite I ? | Ankerite II | Ankerite III |
| –            | Fahlerz II  | Fahlerz III  |
| Quartz I     | Quartz II   | Quartz III   |

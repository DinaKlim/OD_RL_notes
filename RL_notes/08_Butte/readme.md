## Butte, Montana, USA

The Butte deposit is located near the city of the same name, about 50 km SSW of Helena, the capital of Montana. The deposit lies within the Boulder Batholith, a granite that covers approximately 2,000 square miles. It is an intrusive body that has intruded into Precambrian, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic sediments, as well as late Mesozoic andesitic lavas.

Shortly after its consolidation, it was penetrated by aplite-like veins and dikes, some of which exhibit a pegmatitic character. Following the aplite intrusion, there was a phase of brittle tectonics and further intrusions. These intrusions mainly consisted of fine- to coarse-grained quartz porphyries. The quartz-porphyry veins are essentially confined to the deposit area, which today contains copper mineralization.

The three main hydrothermal systems developed in the following sequence:

1. Anaconda System (E-W)

2. Blue System (NW-SE)

3. Steward-Rarus System (NE-SW)

Sales further subdivides the Steward-Rarus group into the Steward, Rarus, and Middle groups. Among these three groups, only the Steward direction is mineralized. The paragenesis is highly complex and additionally displays zonation related to space and time.

A Bornite

B Chalcopyrite

C Chalcocite

D Hematite

E Rhodochrosite

F Siderite

The minerals that were deposited first were quartz, pyrite, and molybdenite vein infills. These minerals formed before the emergence of the Anaconda veins. In the main veins, different stages of mineralization can be distinguished. During the first phase, quartz, pyrite, and sphalerite were deposited. Quartz and pyrite from this early mineralization phase are found in all three zones, into which the deposit is divided.

The zones are referred to as the Central, Intermediate, and Peripheral zones. Larger ZnS occurrences are only found in the outer parts of the zones.

It is possible that at this point in time, ZnS also formed in the Central Zone but was later completely replaced by Cu-sulfides. Part of the primary chalcocite in the Central Zone is pseudomorphic after sphalerite and almost always contains inclusions of sphalerite. In the Intermediate Zone, the ZnS content increases with distance from the Central Zone. The sphalerite of the Intermediate Zone contains inclusions of chalcopyrite in the form of linear or irregular shapes, which are interpreted as exsolution structures and not as replacement.

On a larger scale, ZnS occurs in the Peripheral Zone. It is possible that this sphalerite, which was precipitated from the Central Zone, was displaced and recrystallized here. The copper sulfides in the outer Central Zone and the inner Intermediate Zone seem to have formed later than the ZnS. The following occur as Cu-minerals, in decreasing order of importance: Chalcocite, Bornite, Enargite, Chalcopyrite, Covellite, Tennantite, Tetrahedrite, as well as Digenite and Djurleite.

In the present veins of the Butte deposit, pyrite is the dominant ore mineral. It displays relatively large idiomorphic crystal habits but is significantly fractured. The cracks are filled with bornite, chalcopyrite, and less commonly with enargite and tennantite. Numerous rounded inclusions of various minerals can be seen within the pyrite. These inclusions are not randomly distributed in the pyrite but are arranged around more or less inclusion-free pyrite cores. It can be assumed that the pyrite continued to grow after its formation, enclosing and replacing other minerals in the process.

The mineral enargite is also frequently observed. It is very similar in color to tennantite but somewhat darker and has a slight pinkish tint. In contrast to tennantite, enargite exhibits strong anisotropy and distinct birefringence. If the crystals are not entirely preserved, one can often see uniform enargite plates parallel to specific surfaces enclosed within tennantite.

Copper glance (chalcocite) is quite rare in these veins. It is found in all the veins, but it never forms large grains, only small aggregates in tennantite. Occasionally, it also appears in bornite.

The bornite itself is a later formation. It often replaces the chalcopyrite on certain surfaces and frequently forms a thin rim between pyrite and the adjacent minerals such as enargite and tennantite.

A rare mineral that certainly appears in all the veins is wittichenite (Cu<sub>3</sub>BiS<sub>3</sub>). It occurs mainly in enargite and rarely in pyrite.

It is noticeable that there is no sphalerite in these veins. The samples thus likely originate from the Central Zone of the deposit.
